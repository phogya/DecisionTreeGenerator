Women on Language; Women in Language Poet Muriel Rukeyser envisions English
Oedipus old and blinded asking the Sphinx why he hadn't English
recognized his own mother It was the Sphinx explains his English
answer to the riddle: Man   You didn't say English
anything about woman  When you say Man  said English
Oedipus you include woman too Everyone knows that  She English
said That's what you think  Were Oedipus alive today English
he might offer the same solution to the riddle But English
he would indeed be feigning navet to claim that generic English
man is now understood to include woman Even the most English
casual observers of social movements and language changes are conscious English
of what some might call the crusade for nonsexist language English
Careful feminist writers avoid unthinking use of imagery redolent of English
colonialism and militarism  Though the Seneca Falls convention of English
noted and deplored the silence about women in the Declaration English
of Independence and though nonfeminists have worked toward removing sexism English
from English most current activity stems from the women's movement English
that began in the s Feminists concerned about language relentlessly English
reveal language's capacity to discriminate against women or to render English
them invisible Poking and prodding at contemporary speech and writing English
feminists condemn the use of a term identified with one English
sex or gender to designate all humanity Gender is preferred English
to sex in designating the cultural construct rather than the English
purely biological However some recent studies explore the connection between English
development of linguistic gender and sex gender and the question English
of anatomically determined language is fashionable  Mankind tacitly imposes English
male values on all of humanity; manhours denies women's work English
as a measure; manpower effaces women So too feminists lobby English
for gender neutral terms when appropriate A familiar example: reasoning English
that in terms of job duties the sex or gender English
of the person who passes peanuts on an airplane is English
unimportant editors of the Handbook of Nonsexist Language propose flight English
attendant rather than steward stewardess and oppose gratuitous regendering of English
job titles  female flight attendant  A court case English
notes a male purser and a female stewardess with identical English
job descriptions but different salary scales  Similarly feminists discourage English
titles that identify women's but not men's marital status though English
many users mistakenly assume Ms a synonym for Miss  English
More generally feminists reveal and question implied norms in language English
and hence in our consciousness ranging from the application form's English
unmarried which suggests that marriage is the normal state as English
parents of twins imply double births expected referring to non English
twins as singletons  to more complex issues such as English
those associated with terms like masculine and feminine Anomalies in English
language become evidence What to make of the fact that English
one may be henpecked but not cockpecked? That some of English
us are cleaning ladies but none of us is a English
garbage gentleman? That girls a term suggesting youth but not English
dignity have been females of any age but the call English
on television's Electric Company Hey you guys  summons boys English
and girls alike? The hypothetical modern Oedipus might join some English
humans of both genders who carp at the most radical English
seeming alterations of the language Opponents of nonsexist language show English
passionate loyalty to principles of etymology and tradition and unexpected English
respect for grace and style admittedly frequent victims of inclusion English
of the feminine pronoun More subtle and less readily articulated English
objections probably exist But few proponents of nonsexist language are English
ignorant of the claims of etymology of custom of aesthetics English
or even of the inappropriateness of gender neutral terms in English
a nongender neutral world For them as for most feminists English
political considerations are primary This explains support of herstory or English
`wim min  terms that finesse etymology to emphasize the English
male orientation of conventional history and to eliminate the man English
in the word woman When etymology serves political concerns etymology English
is honored For example one writer cites a preference for English
cunt over vagina because of the latter's derivation from a English
Latin word meaning `sheath ' often sheath for a sword English
 The feminist position recognizes the power of language Language English
is viewed not only as the product but the shaper English
of culture and as such is able to perpetuate or English
discourage discrimination or oppression In spite of symphony auditions of English
barefoot screened musicians church hymnals laced with maternal imagery for English
God commencement addresses to Women and men of Yale  English
affirmative action and the resulting tokenism few feminists think the English
cause won Attitudes toward women often assumed to be natural English
and hence sacred are not easily changed  Nonsexist language English
is no universal antidote But most feminists even recognizing the English
influence of preverbal and nonverbal forces and various sexist institutions English
see acceptance of sexist language as an insidious poison This English
retreading of English this adjusting of it altering it bandaging English
and plastering it to promote a particular vision of society English
is the most widely perceived activity of feminists interested in English
language But it is arguably the simplest philosophically and though English
this is relatively unimportant the least attractive A familiar but English
irrelevant complaint against feminists is that they lack charm as English
though an unappealing style negates the justice of a cause English
Rukeyser's Sphinx was not very affable either  After all English
those who undertake this dirty work are necessarily naysayers rule English
givers censors of the word rather than bringers of it English
Generally anti elitist and anti authoritarian by declaration feminist alterers English
of language find themselves corralled with prescriptive grammarians and linguists English
The issue of nonsexist language envisions men and women as English
subject or object of language Yet this is but one English
aspect of gender and linguistics a subject that has its English
own conferences bibliographies and college courses As literary critics feminists English
look not only at images of women in literature but English
at women as writers and readers So those interested in English
language look at women not only as writers and readers English
but also as speakers and listeners Such inquiry is less English
direct and more exploratory than nonsexist language promotion but is English
no less political Some theorists describe women's relation to language English
as primarily a product of patriarchal oppression; others usually acknowledging English
oppression focus on women's strengths Most investigators feminist and nonfeminist English
alike agree that women's vernacular differs from men's: Jespersen listed English
adjectives favored by women noted women's use of little intensifiers English
Feminists ponder causes implications Does the close adherence of British English
women of all classes to accepted proper norms suggest women's English
repression? Their conservatism? Their upward mobility? What attitude should feminists English
take to women's suggested more frequent use of tag endings English
It's a nice day isn't it? We'll vote Democratic won't English
we?? Identified by early feminist linguist Robin Lakoff women's frequent English
use of tag endings has been both discounted by some English
but not all empirical studies and re examined by other English
studies that distinguish different kinds of tag endings used by English
men and women Those feminists who emphasize success within the English
world as we know it tend to encourage women to English
purge their speech of tag endings and to retrain themselves English
to speak in what is perceived as a more masculine English
more assertive way Others emphasizing women's particular values urge retention English
of this and other features of women's talk for example English
women frequently assume noncompetitive roles in conversation suggesting that women's English
talk encourages participation and the likelihood of consensus Such analyses English
of language pass as traditional in form if not in English
content They echo the old question posed regularly by missionaries English
anthropologists and linguists as to whether women speak or chatter English
 a word used only for females and nonhumans a English
different language a dialect a genderlect with each other and English
with men whether they can do or should speak what English
the title of Dale Spender's book calls Man Made Language English
The answers often appear in measured academic prose When offered English
by feminists the answers frequently appear in a style that English
is marked by word play dependent on written forms; a English
style that is unconventional mannered at its best witty; a English
style that suggests alternatives to those styles that feminists would English
designate male influenced For it is no praise for most English
feminists to be included within the best accepted for which English
read male endorsed tradition Admittedly no party completely purges its English
rhetoric of terms like phallologocentric however  Such a style English
marks both a reference work A Feminist Dictionary and the English
writings of theologian Mary Daly A Feminist Dictionary edited by English
influential Cheris Kramarae and Paula Treichler along with Ann Russo English
suggests the style and the substance of some recent feminist English
discourse The editors disclaim objectivity Yet they imply conventional lexicographers English
are not objective though they neither recognize nor admit it English
For example in lexicographers' frequent reliance on best authors as English
a source dictionaries draw evidence from men more frequently published English
and admired and not women Other significant editorial practices: the English
Feminist Dictionary lexicogaphers refuse to label a word like herstory English
a coinage All words are coinages the editors claim and English
they resist charting relations between their entries and an authorized English
or canonized list of words A Feminist Dictionary includes new English
words and new definitions; words from utopian literature suggest what English
might be; definitions are elaborate the stated aim to stimulate English
research or theoretical development Under A  for example the English
lexicographers provide entries for Adam Ad feminam ageism Ain't I English
a Woman Sojourner Truth's speech and amniocentesis Z is limited English
to three entries: Zamani Soweto sisters Zeitgeist `Spirit of liberty English
equality and sorority' and Zugassent a term for male continence English
as practised by the Oneida utopian community Under L  English
entries include Latin Greek defined by Aphra Behn cited in English
Dale Spender's book as `Secret codes supplied through an education English
traditionally denied women ' Another entry under L is Laadan English
a language constructed by linguist Suzette Hayden Elgin and first English
used in her science fiction novel Native Tongue a language English
which is designed to contain many woman function words not English
included in English British linguist Deborah Cameron in Feminism and English
Linguistic Theory doubts these lacunae suggesting that English is flexible English
and that women are disadvantaged primarily by alienation from high English
language  The energetic defining and developing of a woman's English
language the inevitable doubting and questioning of it is energized English
by the work of French feminists and is displayed in English
the verbal acrobatics of radical feminist theologian Mary Daly For English
example Daly describes the title of one of her early English
books Gyn Ecology as saying exactly what I mean to English
say  It is a way of wrenching back some English
wordpower  and in a way not a mazing a English
typical Daly twirl of language to make the reader re English
examine words to our fore sisters who were the Great English
Hags  terms used in unconventional ways Tacitly Daly like English
most feminists invokes an earlier quieter voice that of Virginia English
Woolf Woolf identified but did not describe a woman's sentence English
and in the same text wrote of women ancestors for English
example Shakespeare's putative sister who was silent silenced by a English
society dominated by men Women's language is often metonymy for English
women's literary style Woolf here suggests two lines of thought English
currently pursued by feminist linguists; feminists both seek to describe English
women's language and to explore the cluster of related conditions English
summarized under the rubric silence  The discussion by women English
about women's language is lively; the discussion of the related English
and complementary topic women's silence is elaborate complex and a English
bit sad Tillie Olsen identifies silent periods when women are English
diverted from their work by needs of their families; Spender English
talks of silence upon silence that has kept women's experience English
from being encoded; Adrienne Rich in On Lies Secrets and English
Silences sees women's struggle for self determination muffled or silenced English
over and over; most recently Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar English
chart women authors' apparent alienation from language their frequent use English
of pseudonyms an attempt at renaming or really naming themselves English
Feminists have much to say about men's claim that women English
talk too much To many it is significant that the English
privilege of naming granted to Adam was denied to Eve English
Modern feminists interested in language may be sisters to Rukeyser's English
Sphinx The Sphinx may be silent as in many traditions English
or not but she and Oedipus who did not recognize English
parents of either gender probably do not understand the same English
language The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing The Nonsexist Word Finder English
The subject of nonsexist language is a matter of genuine English
concern not only to women [see page of this issue] English
but to everyone It ill behooves us to be unfair English
to any segment of the population and it is not English
only immoral but illegal to discriminate against people on virtually English
any basis In recent decades certain changes have taken place English
in the language that reflect voluntary choices of the words English
used to characterize people; these have focused largely on the English
conscious and conscientious substitution of neutral sexless words like individuals English
person and people for terms that normally denote only males English
Journalists and other commentators have sometimes taken a facetious view English
of the situation suggesting that person itself is sexist because English
son denotes `male offspring ' that words like manhole are English
sexist and that even woman  wo + man  English
is sexist By this time the humor if there was English
any there to begin with has worn very thin indeed English
and the end of it would be welcome Then too English
there have been the campaigners who have gone to what English
some regard as opposite extremes: if the head of a English
committee is known to be a man or a woman English
then chairman or chairwoman must surely be the proper denotation; English
if the sex of the person is not known then English
chairperson though awkward sounding is the preferred form But it English
is patently ridiculous to refer to someone whose sex is English
known as a chairperson Chair should be reserved for the English
office of the chairperson not the person holding the office English
Yet many prefer chair to chairperson on the grounds of English
brevity and because it avoids the awkwardness of the longer English
alternative Miller and Swift [M&S] treat this problem and seem English
to believe that it has been solved: The lexicographer Alma English
Graham points out that chair has been recognized in the English
sense of the occupant of the chair as invested with English
its dignity  since the seventeenth century just as the English
Crown has been used for the monarch or the Oval English
Office has come to stand for the President of the English
United States Address your remarks to the chair illustrates metonymy English
a figure of speech in which something is called by English
the name of something else associated with it Nobody understands English
an injunction to address the chair as an order to English
talk to a piece of furniture [pp ] The final English
sentence is about as valid as would be the comment English
that nobody understands such an injunction as an order to English
write the address of the chairperson on a dozen envelopes English
either But there are other specious arguments in the above English
statement:  Recognized ? By whom? The fact that Graham English
has found that citations for such usage exist how old English
they may be is of little consequence is not to English
be construed as evidence that they necessarily existed in sufficient English
profusion to warrant acceptance by the English speaking populations Moreover English
what are the contexts in which the citations were found? English
There are many difficulties inherent in adducing citational evidence unsupported English
by frequency There are many other instances of the misuses English
of citational evidence not only by users of dictionaries but English
by lexicographers themselves: there is no way using the citational English
materials at present appearing in dictionaries as prima facie evidence English
that one would be justified in assuming that a broad English
statistical segment of English speakers is thereby represented; even the English
most cursory examination of entries in the OED which I English
assume to be the source of Graham's information will rapidly English
ineluctably lead the observer to realize that a the evidence English
in the published work is quite thin and b the English
conclusions drawn by the OED's definers and commentators often cannot English
be supported by citational evidenceat least not the citational evidence English
that appears in the published work  That chair is English
used metonymically in the same way as the Crown and English
the Oval Office is true but to refer to the English
office not to the person occupying it Certainly in the English
case of the Crown as ample evidence will show reference English
is so made specifically to avoid mentioning a particular regent English
and not as a figure of speech employed for rhetorical English
effect As for the Oval Office it is mostly used English
when the referent is `authority of the executive branch of English
the government' to avoid identifying the incumbent president personally and English
to indicate official policy In both cases the point is English
exactly opposite that identified by Graham: it is the position English
institution authority etc being referred to and not the occupant English
 By the same token when people address the chair English
they address the office whoever might hold it and not English
the incumbent individual I find little to dispute with M&S English
in the matter of principle But there are two elements English
of their argument that merit further comment The first is English
that I find their interpretation of the evidence often skewed; English
the second is that while adjustment to lexicon which they English
have always strongly advocated is one thing modification of grammar English
is another In referring to an item in The New English
York Times in which youth is used to refer to English
a young woman M&S write: Though the term may once English
have been anomalous when used of a young woman today English
it is a recognized common gender noun and the next English
round of dictionaries will no doubt add their authority to English
the change [p ] The First Edition of The Random English
House Dictionary of the English Language lists youth with a English
definition a young person esp a young man; the Second English
Edition published after the M&S Handbook and presumably in the English
next round they refer to defines the word as a English
young person esp a young man or male adolescent  English
Thus the evidence at the RHD offices indicated the need English
for reinforcement of the notion of maleness associated with the English
word not as M&S suggest a trend toward epicenism I English
am not entirely in agreement with the RHD treatment for English
personally I believe that youth has lately appeared more and English
more often in context like youth center youth rehabilitation etc English
where the context is clearly common gender and the foregoing English
is merely set out as a warning to those who English
try to predict what lexicographers are likely to do On English
the other hand I do not have the hard evidence English
at hand and assume that the RHD does The following English
appears in bold italics on page : To go on English
using in its former sense a word whose meaning has English
changed is counterproductive The point is not that we should English
recognize semantic change but that in order to be precise English
in order to be understood we must I am not English
sure that I should have characterized the perpetuation of obsolete English
or archaic meanings as counterproductive: perhaps wrong  misleading  English
ambiguous  or old fashioned would have been closer to English
the mark; phrased another way I must agree that people English
ought to use words in their current senses if they English
expect to be understood Most do of course use them English
that way When will people learn that dictionaries are not English
the product of the collective imaginations of those who prepare English
them or the manifestations of the dreams of a single English
lexicographer but the result of lengthy painstaking research to determine English
how the language is being used the analysis and codification English
of the results and then their organization into a usable English
reference source? What is counterproductive is the notion that speakers English
of a language have to recognize semantic change: they don't English
recognize it they create it Of course if a researcher English
tampers with the evidence making a unilateral unsupported claim or English
assumption that a word means something that it does not English
then that does not constitute semantic change: it is what English
is known as dirty work at the crossroads and M&S English
are indulging in a bit of mischief by suggesting that English
semantic change either has taken place or is taking place English
because they have some evidence that a certain change in English
usage had crept in Notwithstanding the unfortunate fact that the English
gathering and assessment of citational evidence is not what it English
should or might be I should still put my money English
on professional lexicographers and their resources rather than on M&S English
In Chapter  Man as a False Generic  M&S English
question whether the definitions  the creature Homo sapiens at English
the highest level of animal development characterized esp by a English
highly developed brain the human race; mankind  [from the English
College Edition of the RHD ] are still fully operative English
or whether the first limited meaning [`an adult male person English
as distinguished from a boy or woman '] has in English
effect become the only valid one in modern English  English
I trust that this is a fillip of propaganda and English
not a serious query To be sure it is the English
most common meaning which is why it is listed first English
But one must contend not only with the way the English
word might be used today but with the evidence of English
centuries of culture reflected in billions upon billions upon billions English
of words of text all of which shape the way English
we think and speak There is nothing wrong with trying English
to change that shape and advocates of nonsexist English have English
worked miracles in the short time since they have succeeded English
in making their concerns known But to deny that the English
oblique senses of man are still very much with us English
is mere optimistic folly And there is no gainsaying the English
fact that the first sense of man `male human' tends English
to contaminate if that is the right word the oblique English
senses But grammar enters the picture here too and dictionaries English
are remiss in syntactic description of how the language works English
in comparison with what its words mean how they are English
spelled and pronounced and where they came from To put English
it differently it is not yet the function of the English
dictionary to show that articles definite or indefinite are not English
usually found preceding man in senses and but are invariably English
present before sense uses No normal speaker of English encountering English
Man wants but little here below wondersexcept facetiouslywhy women have English
been ignored More likely they read wants as meaning `desires' English
rather than `lacks ' but that might well be a English
deliberate facetious ambiguity We use terms like Neanderthal Man Peking English
Man etc without believing for a moment that there were English
no Neanderthal or Peking women leaving aside Peking Toms Cartoonists English
might depict a child asking a parent about Neanderthal women English
but that is recognizably a joke that depends for its English
humor on the characterization of the questioner as a fool: English
that it is a child is irrelevant; it might be English
Edith Bunker Perhaps the most significant comment on the failure English
to distinguish between man generic and man `male human' appears English
on page : When Edith Bunker on the television series English
All in the Family  quoted Sam Walter Foss's Let English
me live in my house by the side of the English
road And be a friend of man  Archie's response English
was Yeah I heard about them kind of houses in English
the army  Is it possible that M&S are serious English
in invoking Archie Bunker the archbigot of all time as English
a model of understanding and a paragon of modern English English
usage? There are many thousands of such jokes in every English
language for they depend for their humor on polysemy or English
homonymy which exists in all languages Yet this nonsense is English
compounded Lexicographers appear to agree Although they do not label English
the supposedly generic meaning of man obsolete they write some English
definitions as though we all know it is For example English
Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary  defines a man about English
town as a wordly and socially active man  But English
if man sometimes means any human being  should not English
the definition of man about town read a wordly and English
socially active person of the male sex? How can the English
definers be sure we will know without being told that English
a man about town is never a woman? [p ] English
On the face of it one might dismiss this question English
as just so much rubbish and wonder how people of English
the intelligence of M&S could possibly have come to frame English
it The answer has nothing to do with their cause English
however but with the simple fact that dictionaries are not English
exercises in bi unique substitutability; in other words if one English
of the senses of run is `operate' as in She English
runs an engine factory  that does not make it English
valid to assume that one can substitute operate for run English
in We run in the marathon every year Although recognizing English
this as a shortcoming of dictionaries and assigning it arbitrarily English
to what for lack of a better term we might English
call the genius of the language might seem trivial to English
the casual observer it is a valid matter for concern English
in the realm of lexicology Using it to bolster an English
argument is plainly a mistake Unfortunately the mistake is compounded English
and perpetuated by dragging in expressions like man in the English
street the average working man and others and as a English
result the entire argument degenerates Perhaps we ought to be English
saying street person for the first and working stiff for English
the second but the first has been pre empted and English
it seems a little incongruous to find anyone actively seeking English
to be called a stiff  There are actually two English
things at work in the Handbook : one is a English
genuine concern when a generalized statement about people is to English
be made about being unfair to women through the use English
of references which though denotatively neutral carry the strong scent English
of maleness That is if you are going to say English
something about people then avoid using the word man for English
example because regardless of the ancillary definitions one might find English
in the dictionary in its most common meaning and use English
it denotes `male' and the strong connotations of that denotation English
are carried over to all other applications of the word: English
it is not in fact as neutral as some believe English
it to be If that is what M&S mean why English
don't they just say so? The other thing is that English
generalized statements employing reference to males constitute a not so English
subtle form of propaganda interpretable either as pro male anti English
female or both A third possibility though naturally not treated English
by M&S is out and out misanthropy vs misogyny for English
the notion of simple man hating should not be ruled English
out entirely As a male reader I get strong vibrations English
from this book that the authors advocate the paranoid view English
that everything in the language that is not exactly as English
they would like it to be is the result of English
a gigantic hate program against women In that context one English
is given to wonder about the circumstances in languages that English
have grammatical not sex gender  The remainder of Chapter English
is mainly a catalogue of misinterpretations aberrations and plain errors English
regarding the use of man as a generic A number English
of excellent suggestions to help people avoid the inadvertent expression English
of prejudice are offered albeit interspersed among excoriating castigatory comments English
that are entirely irrelevant to The Cause hence diminish the English
impact and strength of purpose of both It is indeed English
a pity that the authors persist in expressing their ideas English
as they do for were they more practical and not English
so aggressively all inclusive in their condemnation of the slightest English
hint of maleness they would probably serve their cause more English
successfully Curiously British English of all things! has provided a English
solution of sorts to the perennial ancillary problem of the English
neutral he  as the pronoun of reference in the English
language In British English it is no longer considered a English
solecism to use the plurals they their them theirs as English
a generalized pronoun for words like eyeryone everybody anyone anybody English
etc Thus it has become standard British English to say English
or write Everyone can get their copy at the bookshop English
Everybody should make certain to take their own coat etc English
I don't know about Canada Australia etc but in the English
U S this kind of referent usage is considered a English
heinous illiteracy by those who consider such matters and those English
who wish to appear educated would be wise to avoid English
it It scarcely needs pointing out that the British usage English
was not brought about by any sense of justice toward English
women but by the apparent fact that the people in English
Britain are not quite as uptight about usage as the English
Americans The second chapter of the Handbook is devoted in English
its entirety to The Pronoun Problem mercifully concluding with the English
expression of some doubt that an artificial generic pronoun like English
hir thon per and other abominations is likely to take English
hold Chapter Generalizations treats with good sense methods that can English
be employed to avoid sexism in a wide variety of English
constructions Alas M&S continue to take up the cudgel carping English
against writing which in some cases antedates recognition of a English
problem: it is like nattering on about how awful the English
Romans were because they condoned slavery; rather a waste of English
space time and motion Wot? Much that might have been English
offered with sober good advice here is contaminated by an English
obsessive concern with the identification of the sex of the English
perpetrator of past injustices The approach is vindictive and castigatory English
Other libertarian movements advocate similar policies: it is not enough English
that wrongs be righted; the discrimination and other injustices suffered English
by past generations back through the ages must be avenged English
and the descendants of those responsible must be made to English
pay for those crimes and somehow to compensate the descendants English
of the sufferers Such policies are not only asinine they English
areand here I have found another appropriate place for the English
buzz word of the decade counterproductive: the energies expended on English
vengeance are entirely wasted and should be channeled to changing English
the present system to ensure that they are not continued English
Although we continue to track down criminals who did their English
dirt in WWII we do business with and carry on English
other normal relations with the descendants of the Nazis and English
of those who bombed Pearl Harbor The sins of our English
forebears should not be visited upon us In the same English
way those who support equal rights for women would be English
well advised to concentrate on the issues at hand and English
not contaminate their cause with trivia like whether Romeo and English
Juliet or Antony and Cleopatra ought to have the order English
of the names reversed in odd numbered years so that English
women get top billing While that has not been literally English
proposed as far as I know the fact that the English
men's names appear first has been used by some feminists English
to illustrate the manifestation of an attitude that women have English
had to put up with all these centuries Seeing Women English
and Girls as People Chapter settles down to some good English
advice describing what might be offensive to women and how English
to get around it through paraphrase M&S also go out English
of their way to praise usages that neatly sidestep offensive English
usage Specific cliches working wife working mother house wife etc English
are discussed with sober explanations of why they are offensive English
and with suggestions for suitable alternatives Chapter covers Parallel Treatment English
quite properly bearing down on descriptions in which a man English
and his petite blonde wife appear They go too far English
though when they attack I lost my job in place English
of They fired me on the grounds that such phrasing English
contributes to the harmful stereotype of `woman as victim ' English
 What unmitigated nonsense! Men say that too of course English
To be fair M&S also criticize identifications mainly from news English
stories of women as mother of five and other gratuitous English
characterizations that are not only irrelevant to the item's newsworthiness English
but are rarely offered about men Chapter discusses under A English
Few More Words a number of suffixes  trix ess English
etc  and words  hero heroine alumnus alumna alumni English
alumnae etc  that apparently offend the authors: they campaign English
for the elimination of la diffrence My own attitude is English
that I find such terms not in the least denigrating: English
Why should a woman object to being called a heroine English
a divorce or an actress any more than being called English
a female or a woman? I see the rather boring English
point about using alumni to cover both men and women English
and I quite agree that the use of relatively newer English
and less widely used terms like authoress aviatrix and poetess English
seems to be a deliberate unwarranted attempt to identify someone English
as a female; but a graduate of the feminine gender English
is a `woman graduate' = alumna the `first woman dancer English
in a ballet company' is a prima ballerina I've never English
heard of a prime ballerino and a `woman opera star' English
is a diva or prima donna I hesitate to point English
out that we use prima donna of men too because English
my critics will say that they disapprove of the term's English
second life as designating a temperamental person of either sex English
' These of course are loanwords borrowed from languages that English
have or had grammatical gender The same is true of English
heroine and thousands of other words What are we to English
do? The answer is not clear unless we accept a English
policy of drawing up a very long list of taboo English
words A short list is not impossible for it would English
join words like nigger kike mackerelsnapper and others The book English
concludes with A Brief Thesaurus which lists a few offending English
words and their suggested alternatives If this were indeed to English
have been a handbook users would have found a longer English
list more useful There follows a desexing section on maxims English
for He who laughs last laughs best read The last English
laugh is the best: not only does it not say English
the same thing but the second is totally lacking in English
the rhetorical devices packed into the first and a two English
page bibliography reference notes to chapters and an index On English
the last page is a short biographical note about the English
authors in which through pronoun references we learn that both English
are women The Nonsexist Word Finder subtitled A Dictionary of English
Gender Free Usage opens with a foreword by Miller and English
Swift Most of the book is an A Z listing English
of words that are for the most part sexist but English
as the author sets forth in the User's Guide Some English
words are included here because they are ambiguous: Is a English
belly dancer always a woman? Is a Canadian Mountie always English
a man? Odd question that; I had to phone the English
Canadian consulate to find out that there have been female English
Mounties since though one might question their approval of being English
so designated As for belly dancers not only have I English
never heard of a male belly dancer but find the English
very idea more exotic than erotic Put on what in English
the military they like to call a need to know English
basis then why not distinguish between belly dancer and belly English
danseuse ?though I daresay the author Rosalie Maggio would scarcely English
approve of danseuse Put another way are not these very English
questions sexist? In one sense they are but if people English
were to pay hard cash to watch a belly dancer English
only to find that it was a man I think English
they might have some justification in asking for their money English
back I would feel the same way if I paid English
to see the Rockettes only find that they were Rockets English
 There would probably be little chance of a refund English
if the place were run by a feminist Is a English
men's room attendant always a man? Any man who has English
traveled in Europe knows the answer to be No The English
entries themselves are more or less helpful depending on the English
information one is seeking The treatment ranges from an explanation English
of a term to a list of alternatives Here are English
two typical entries: according to Hoyle according to by the English
book according to playing by the rules absolutely correct cricket English
in point of honor on the square proper correct way English
to do things See Appendix A for the rationale on English
avoiding sex linked metaphors expressions and figures acolyte usage of English
this word varies from one time culture and religion to English
another In the Roman Catholic Church for example women can English
function as acolytes one of the minor orders of the English
diaconate but may not be officially installed as acolytes Insofar English
as it means attendant  an acolyte can be either English
a man or a woman Reference to the designated section English
in Appendix A reveals a brief discussion of the subject English
of sex linked metaphors which quite correctly points out that English
many common metaphors metonyms and allusions refer to males Achilles' English
heel before you can say Jack Robinson Bluebeard David and English
Goliath and many more Why should one assume Hoyle to English
be a man? Maggio does not get bent out of English
shape about these providing the following advice: There is nothing English
wrong with any of [these images] in themselves However their English
cumulative effect tends to be overpowering This dictionary lists alternatives English
for many of these expressions not so that they can English
be removed from the language but so that you can English
attempt to balance your writing and speaking with both female English
and male images or use alternatives when gender fairness is English
not possible In addition there are times when it is English
awkward and illogical to use a male metaphor for a English
woman There is nothing ungrammatical or wrong about saying She's English
a real Johnny comelately  but it grates It is English
hard to imagine anyone regardless of sex enjoying being referred English
to as a Johnny come lately The self styled humorists English
could have a field day with this one too suggesting English
She's a Jacquelyn of all trades or the sexless Robin English
Crusoe I looked up in the dictionary section a few English
of the allusions that cannot really be paraphrased At Bluebeard English
advice is given to avoid reference to him completely which English
is understandable on nonlinguistic grounds too Superman the character is English
not in nor is there an entry for Mutt and English
Jeff Don Quixote is listed in the Appendix but I English
could not find him in the dictionary nor could I English
find quixotic Queen of Sheba Jeeves Venus Einstein for `genius' English
Hitler for `demagogue tryant' Attila the Hun for `barbarian' Robinson English
Crusoe for `castaway; lonely person'but man Friday is in Horatio English
Alger Narcissus etc But what are we to do about English
eponyms? Were the two Washingtons state and D C  English
named for George or Martha? Some people mistakenly think that English
the slang term for a commode was named for Thomas English
Crapper English plumber Leotards and daguerreotypes will have to go English
For the most part as might be expected Maggio's alternatives English
and equivalents are phrasal definitions which if assiduously applied would English
effectively sterilize all writing The interesting and useful entries are English
those in which the author explains without the frenetic anguish English
that pervades the M&S book why the term is offensive English
I cannot say that I agree with everything she says English
nor with every item selected for inclusion but on the English
whole the book comes off as a very good treatment English
of the subject Such books are an education Were I English
in a positionsay as editor of a newspaperin which I English
was responsible for treating the kinds of subjects that might English
be construed as sensitive to antiwoman prejudice I should find English
The Nonsexist Word Finder the sanest of the lot and English
the easiest to understand and use Compared with The Handbook English
of Nonsexist Writing it covers much more territory and readers English
are made to feel that the author is cueing them English
in to the information she thinks they ought to have English
The Handbook is a polemical work; despite its title it English
is not organized the way a handbook for writers editors English
etc normally would be It might have been more useful English
as a handbook had it cleaved more closely to the English
structural model of standard style manuals My greatest objection to English
it is its argumentative disputatious tone which frequently borders on English
the vituperative It is as if you looked up say English
infer imply in a usage manual and the author's treatment English
in place of an explanation and sound advice were an English
unpleasant diatribe against anyone so dense and rude as to English
have had to look up the entry to begin with English
M&S are testywhich they may have every right to be English
in light of the trials and tribulations of womenbut their English
moody petulance does not lead to a winning let alone English
diplomatic style and their purpose is accordingly ill served As English
for me I do my utmost to avoid language that English
may offend people including men I refuse out of conservatism English
and sheer curmudgeonliness to give up English grammar like the English
neutral pronouns of reference when I cannot paraphrase without losing English
what little elegance there may be in my writing and English
I refuse to sacrifice metonyms metaphors allusions and other figures English
of speech that contain male referents substituting big liar for English
Baron Munchhausen and Peeping Thomasina for Peeping Tom or trying English

Miami Florida Submitted by ] How Big Is Your Dictionary? English
Britain and North America are not only literate but dictionarate English
 In Britain the dictionary's success is shown by the English
fact that more than percent of households possess at least English
one making the dictionary far more popular than cookery books English
about percent and indeed significantly more widespread than the Bible English
which was to be found in percent of households in English
England in according to the Bible Society In North America English
It was established some years ago that there are more English
dictionaries than television sets  Preface American Heritage Illustrated Encyclopedic English
Dictionary  So you dear reader probably own a dictionary English
But how big is it? Let us consider two recent English
British dictionaries The Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary of  English
Cobuild  boasts xxiv plus pages The Collins English Dictionary English
of  CED  has xxvii plus Looking at these English
figures or at the books themselves one would assume that English
the two dictionaries are of roughly the same size And English
in one sense they are But between water and watt English
there are fifty four main entries in Cobuild and in English
CED They share such entries as water biscuit and waterworks English
But in addition CED alone enters water measurer a `bug' English
Watford a `town north of London' etc On the other English
hand the shared main entry for watershed has twenty three English
words in CED but in Cobuild And the word waterless English
is a main entry in Cobuild explained in twenty words English
whereas in CED it is naught but a so called English
undefined runonmerely mentioned but not explained explicitly as a sub English
entry at water So CED enters more items than Cobuild English
but devotes less space to explaining them And that is English
probably as it should be CED is intended for the English
adult native speaker of English whose main concern is with English
understanding a large number of unfamiliar items including proper names English
encountered in reading and listening Cobuild is intended for the English
foreign learner of English whose dual concern is with understanding English
and using the core vocabulary of English and who having English
achieved that aim can graduate to a dictionary for native English
speakerslike CED More generally the size of a dictionary is English
a function of two variables: the number of items entered English
its macrostructure and the amount of information given about them English
its microstructure In Charles McGregor's words a dictionary that says English
a lot about a little and one that says a English
little about a lot can end up roughly the same English
size Cobuild and CED are far from being such polar English
opposites but they exemplify this general point In measuring dictionaries English
how far can we rely on the dictionaries' own estimates English
of their size? Let us consider the dust jacket blurbs English
of Cobuild CED and two other native speaker dictionaries: the English
British Longman Dictionary of the English Language Longman  and English
the American Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary  W  English
Here is what they say : Cobuild: over references CED: English
references Longman: Over definitions and more than headwords W: Almost English
entries and definitions Both Longman and W estimate their macrostructure English
 headwords entries  and their microstructure  definitions  English
But what of Cobuild and CED ? What do they English
mean by references ? In CED the relevant definition of English
reference seems to be a book or passage referred to English
 or perhaps a mention or allusion; in Cobuild something English
such as a number or name that tells you where English
you can obtain the information that you want for example English
from a book list or map  We are none English
the wiser It is only from an article about CED English
that we learn it has  entries  which suggests English
that Collins means by references what Merriam Webster means by English
entries But CED and Cobuild certainly do not say so! English
And what about Longman's headwords ? Their relevant definition of English
headword is a word or term placed at the beginning English
e g of a chapter or an entry in a English
dictionary  Does that mean that the number of headwords English
equals the number of entries? And that therefore Longman's macrostructure English
number of entries  is much smaller than that of English
W or CED ? We need to look more closely English
at the meaning of entry For entry our four dictionaries English
have this to say in their relevant definitions: Cobuild: a English
short article about someone or something in a dictionary or English
encyclopedia CED: an item recorded as in a diary dictionary English
or account Longman: a dictionary headword [!] often together with English
its definition W: b : HEADWORD : a headword with English
its definition or identification : VOCABULARY ENTRY W's relevant definition English
of headword does not even mention dictionaries: a word or English
term placed at the beginning as of a chapter or English
an entry in an encyclopedia But its definition of vocabulary English
entry is about dictionaries only: a word as the noun English
book hyphened or open compound as the verb book match English
or the noun book review word element as the affix English
pro  abbreviation as agt verbalized symbol as Na or English
term as man in the street entered alphabetically in a English
dictionary for the purpose of definition or identification or expressly English
included as an inflected form as the noun mice or English
the verb saw or as a derived form as the English
noun godlessness or the adverb globally or related phrase as English
one for the book run on at its base word English
and usu set in a type as boldface readily distinguishable English
from that of the lightface running text which defines explains English
or identifies the entry If we can sort out all English
the details hereno mean taskit emerges that W 's vocabulary English
entries include both what I earlier called main entries like English
watershed  and what I called subentries like waterless in English
CED  But it appears that Longman's headwords are only English
those that are or introduce main entries So we still English
have no way of knowing whether Longman's macrostructure is smaller English
or larger than W 's! Nor do our troubles end English
here For in its Explanatory Notes p  W not English
only calls our attention to the definition of vocabulary entry English
in this book  but also introduces us to a English
wholly new notion that of dictionary entry : The term English
dictionary entry includes all vocabulary entries as well as all English
boldface entries in the separate sections of the back matter English
headed Abbreviations and Symbols for Chemical Elements  Foreign Words English
and Phrases  Biographical Names  Geographical Names  and English
Colleges and Universities  No sooner have we assumed that English
W's macrostructure of Almost entries means vocabulary entries than we English
must face the possibility that it includes such other dictionary English
entries as Harvard U McGill U and Abilene Christian U English
Have they been counted in? We simply do not know English
But as a British journalist might say we should be English
told For W's exemplary precision in telling us what vocabulary English
entries and dictionary entries are is offset by its vagueness English
about which type of entry its PR wallahs have counted English
for their blurb Furthermore our gratitude to Longman and W English
for saying something about the size of their microstructures is English
offset by our sorrowful recognition of how little they say English
Counting definitions is a start But a definition can range English
from a single word synonym  entry b : HEADWORD English
to the words of W's definition of vocabulary entry and English
beyond! And the microstructure of dictionaries includes more than just English
definitions: it can embrace examples illustrations synonym essays usage essays English
etymologies and all sorts of other information Everyone talks nowadays English
about making dictionaries user friendlier How about making their publicity English
buyer friendlier as well? Aux armes citoyens ! Let us English
strive to get dictionary publishers to cry their wares in English
ways that allow us to compare them But citoyens let English
us not forget that the value of a dictionary resideth English
not in size alone The best dictionary for me is English
the one that gives about the word or phrase that English
puzzles me the information I need at the moment I English
need it People have different reference needs at different times English
The standardization of the way dictionaries estimate how much they English
contain need not and should not entail the standardization of English
what they contain Those who have driven along the New English
York State Thruway west of Albany encounter a string of English
town names that presumably reflect the nationalities of their original English
settlers Amsterdam was settled by the Dutch Geneva by the English
Swiss etc till one passes by a town apparently settled English
by the BritishSodus The Other Picture [caption] A painting  English
by Andrew Festing of about of the Members of Parliament English
who had earlier been omitted from a portrait of Members English
drawn by lot who had been immortalized in by June English
Mendoza The painting which includes seven scenes on a canvas English
in by in is entitled The Other Picture: A view English
of the smoking room and library of the House of English
Commons in March commissioned for the House by of the English
members of Parliament who were not included in the Official English
Painting  The Times May p The Fifth Estate It English
began in medieval Europe and in the late th century English
it is everywhere in the world Its overall influence is English
profound but undiscussed although aspects of that influence are discussed English
constantly under headings like language  education  standards  English
literacy  literature  science  and medicine  There English
is little that it does not touch being physically present English
in the architecture of schools psychologically present when we talk English
and think about what makes us civilized linguistically present in English
much of modern communication and in what we call educated English
usage Yet is has no name Let me therefore give English
it a name: the scholarly guild  The phrase is English
a reminder of its medieval provenance its academic focus and English
its corporate style This guild of scholars is one of English
the most successful enterprises in the history of our species English
Indeed some of its th century members gave our species English
the elevated title Homo sapiens as if thinking of themselves English
while labeling all the birds beasts and bugs in creation English
The guild takes many forms now but it retains much English
of the Middle Ages of the ecclesiastical Schoolmen who gathered English
together in quasi monastic colleges  behind walls that marked English
them off from the rest of the world a phenomenon English
that in England is still called town and gown The English
men and increasingly the women who have inherited the mantle English
of the Schoolmen have no trouble recognizing each other They English
live similar lives conduct similar courses and with similar subventions English
go to similar conferences and give similar papers on every English
continent much as David Lodge describes them in Small World English
 They are not as tightly knit as other fraternities English
past and present Knights Templar Freemasons Jesuits Mafia Ancient and English
Mystical Order of the Rosy Cross corporate executives of Coca English
Cola or Chrysler or managers of labor unions The guild's English
gentler cohesion and lack of obvious international hierarchies have contributed English
to its marked success and curious anonymity Its institutions take English
many forms and survive under many different political regimes They English
possess neither a Vatican nor a Vicar General to report English
to and although the guild can at times be arcane English
with Latin charters and capping ceremonies by and large its English
doings are overt and benign Historically the bulk of the English
human race has never known a classroom let alone a English
cloister or an ivory tower or met up with teachers English
empowered by letters after their names Nowadays however there are English
few people who have not come across colleges and college English
graduates or at the periphery of things been invited to English
learn to read and write That is a physical and English
social measure of the guild's success Its continuance seems assured English
Working in its favor is a social contract with a English
three part system established in every country in the world: English
Bottom up progression: the young being inducted into school at English
an early age and proceeding level by level to institutions English
of ever higher learning stopping off for various reasons at English
various levels usually marked by tests and the distribution of English
certificates providing a social grade These processes are often reinforced English
with such comments from parents and teachers as You'll never English
get anywhere nowadays without a college education  There are English
even league tables among nations showing the percentages of those English
who stay in the system longer Top down rank: an English
apex of professors and doctors buttressed by the holders of English
college degrees many of them lower level administrators teachers and English
researchers within the system These are in turn surrounded and English
supported by holders of school certificates and other qualifications Spreading English
out from the base of the pyramid are those who English
have less suitably certified educations or no formal education at English
all people who may have mixed feelings about book learning English
 big words  fancy degrees  eggheads  highbrows English
 and absent minded professors  as well as the English
perils of scholarship science and technology Within the system there English
are others with similar mixed feelings but by and large English
the system remains intact We all send our kids to English
school Language appropriate to level: a basic ability to read English
and write followed by the capacity to handle abstract usage English
and at a higher level to be at ease with English
what Philip Gove in Webster's Third called ISV `international scientific English
vocabulary ' For English this means a capacity to add English
the Latinate onto the vernacular then Greek onto the Latinate English
so that you can eat a hearty breakfast and be English
cordial afterwards without suffering from cardiac arrest Beyond English entry English
into the guild may mean acquiring a special language of English
education such as French in Senegal and English in Kenya English
because many of the world's tongues are not yet and English
may not ever be part of the circle of standardized English
print languages in which the work of the guild can English
be conducted You and I gentle reader are accredited members English
of the guild This is demonstrated in a variety of English
ways: a shared literacy and the assumptions and biases that English
go with it; an awareness of what books are for; English
consciousness and use of innumerable cultural allusions and educated idioms; English
and a relative ease in reading a periodical called VERBATIM English
with sections called OBITER DICTA and EPISTOLAE We are generally English
capable of conducting ourselves in the company of others who English
have been group educated to college level In school college English
and university people have for some six centuries been receiving English
diplomas and titles to prove that in varying degrees a English
loaded word they are educated Oftener than not use of English
language establishes membership and social cum educational rank as clearly English
as any parchment One of the less pleasant ways in English
which such rank can be pulled is to label the English
linguistically less secure illiterate  They too can read and English
write of course but their solecisms  barbarisms  and English
vulgarisms call for rebuke and what better rebuke than to English
treat them as if they did not belong at allto English
condemn them figuratively to the outer darkness of the unlettered? English
Subtler still is the label self educated applied to people English
who have little formal learning Thomas Hardy described an extreme English
case in Jude the Obscure The scholarly guild has always English
interested itself in language its standards and usage its literature English
and classics its mediums media of manuscript and print its English
academic apparatus and Latin tags It places a high value English
on success with such things Its members have tended to English
place a lower value on rural and urban dialect popular English
culture and folklore These are only accepted into the canon English
of good usage and literature after a long and vigorous English
rearguard action Only now for example is the soap opera English
with its enormous social impact beginning to be recognized as English
a fit topic for academic analysis Movies and soaps attain English
respectability when there are enough papers in learned journals and English
theses in bound volumes to elevate them beyond being merely English
popular It is similar with members low on the ladder English
of rank Once upon a time there was a playwright English
who knew little Latin and less Greek Much of his English
skill was acquired in the hurly burly of life but English
his works had a certain merit With the passage of English
time he was canonized by the guild and his Complete English
Works have been annotated and organized by folk with doctorates English
in Shakespearian Studies He made it to the top It English
can be done but it is rare The guild's institutions English
have in their unobtrusively ubiquitous way become more powerful than English
both the Catholic Christianity which gave them birth and the English
regimes of Europe that scattered them round the world Their English
diaspora has been so successful that most of us unreflectingly English
see schools as the natural dispensers controllers instruments and structures English
of educationand of educated discourseeverywhere on earth It is another English
measure of the guild's success that we can hardly imagine English
an alternative to it The utopian communes of anarchists socialists English
and hippies for example have not even dented it After English
centuries of social and cultural direction from the guild's leaders English
the professorial elite the academic scientific and medical establishments it English
is hardly possible for anyone in the Western or Westernizing English
world today to be reckoned or to feel educated without English
having been to schooland the more school the better It English
may be possible to imagine alternatives or significant adaptations if English
we wish them only after we have found the right English
label for the subject Societies seldom see what is central English
in their own cultures having much less trouble identifying it English
in the cultures of others Historians have often discussed the English
three estates of the Western worldnobility church and commons Many English
of us also from time to time talk about a English
fourth estatethe media The idea of social estates can be English
taken one stage further to the global agglomeration of educational English
and scientific communities They constitute a fifth estate  an English
entity as worthy of anthropological investigation as the Yanomama of English
the Amazon or the Dinka of the Sudan Unfortunately just English
as we find it hard to imagine the guild as English
a whole and to envisage alternatives to it so no English
organization exists outside this fifth estate that could investigate it English
Anthropology is one of its own more recent subdivisions So English
who might assess these diplomaed assessors? There appears to be English
only one solution A traditional aim of the guild is English
the quest for truth If that aim is sincere and English
by and large it seems to be the fifth estate English
may yet turn the bright light of science and scholarship English
on itself That would be an interesting day Texican English English
is a mongrel tongue It is basically composed of percent English
Anglo Saxon and percent Romance including Latin and Greek words English
The remaining percent are either invented  laser bogus splurge English
 or have been borrowed from more than other languages English
or dialects from Arabic to Zulu No other national language English
even comes close to that One reason for this diversity English
is the custom of English speaking explorers and pioneers in English
a new land to adopt the native name for unfamiliar English
plants animals and things Other cultures do not follow this English
custom When the Greeks first saw a huge animal in English
Egypt they called it hippopotamus the Greek word for `water English
horse ' When the Boers first saw a strange animal English
in South Africa they called it aardvark a Dutch word English
for `earth pig ' The English however seeing a large English
bearlike animal in Indo China adopted the Nepalese name panda English
; and a strange water mammal was given its Javanese English
name dugong When two peoples speaking different languages share a English
common border there is an infiltration of words from one English
language to the other The north border of the United English
States is with Canada most of whose people share our English
common English speech True the official language of the province English
of Quebec is French; and true we have borrowed a English
few words from there; lacrosse for example But the south English
border is another matter For more than years since the English
Anglos arrived in Texas there has been a culture transfer English
back and forth across the Rio Grande The process is English
still going on Fifteen years ago few people north of English
San Antonio had heard of burritos fajitas flautas or chalupas English
Today thanks to franchise Mexican restaurants they have become a English
part of America's vocabulary Other food names that have passed English
through the Texas pipeline into common usage are chile enchilada English
taco tamale tortilla frjol frito picante jalapeo nacho mescal tequila English
and margarita It may be interesting to note the Spanish English
borrowed chile tamale mescal and mesquite from the indigenous Indians English
before passing them on to us Let us now pass English
on to the names of some clothing items that Texans English
borrowed and then passed on to the rest of the English
country: sombrero mantilla poncho rebozo serape and huarache A number English
of animals and vegetables followed the same route: avocado from English
aguacate; mesquite; sapodilla from zapote; guayule; coyote; armadillo; ocelot from English
ocelote; chaparral ; and javalina from jabalina Since cattle ranching English
is common to both sides of the border it should English
come as no surprise that there has been an exchange English
of ranch related words: lariat from la reata; bronco; lasso English
from lazo; rodeo; chaps from chaparreras; charro; hackamore from jquima; English
mustang from mestengo ; and quirt from cuerda or cuarta English
Finally there is a miscellaneous group of words Alamo the English
site of the Texas defeat by Santa Ana; hoosegow from English
juzgado `court'; dinero `money ' a Spanish corruption of the English
Latin denarius; macho from the same root as machete : English
he who wields a machete must be skillful and powerful English
hence the word has come to mean `virile' and its English
associated noun machismo `virility ' A gringo from griego `Greek English
' is one whose speech sounds like Greek to me English
 The story that it comes from the song Green English
Grow the Lilacs  said to have been sung at English
San Jacinto is an example of folk etymology Let us English
not forget marijuana which is simply `Mary Jane' in Mexico English
or cucaracha the `cockroach' that entered English via a popular English
song Some time ago Texans picked up a speech habit English
that is being acquired by the rest of the country English
When Texans in particular South Texans want to emphasize a English
statement they often use a Spanish word If they want English
to be emphatic about a large undertaking they might say English
I'm going to do it all! The entire thing! The English
whole enchilada!  About someone who is in complete charge English
of a project they could say He runs things completely! English
He's the boss! Nmero uno!  Then there is negation: English
I had nothing to do with that! Nothing at all! English
Nada!  And to request confirmation they might well say English
You do it exactly this way! You'd better do it English
right! Comprende ? Texas has contributed a few good words English
to the English language without any help from Spanish or English
Mexican During the s a Texas lawyer acquired a small English
herd of cattle on Matagorda Island Because he knew little English
about the cattle business and cared less he never got English
around to branding his stock That man was Samuel Maverick English
As time passed cattlemen began calling all unbranded cattle mavericks English
The word spread throughout Texas and into English generally And English
its meaning expanded to mean any nonconformist Then there are English
the cattalo and the beefalo crosses between cattle and buffalo English
first attempted in Texas A jackalope is an imaginary horned English
rabbit reputedly inhabiting West Texas These fifty words that have English
entered English after a brief sojourn in Texas can be English
found in almost any dictionary That is to say about English
one of every thousand English words came into the language English
via Texas If the average American uses from three to English
five thousand different words each day the chances are everybody English
in this country will use three or more Texican words English
Hidden Compounds The compounding process is a simple economical system English
of word formation is modern English Compounding native English words English
or elements produces all classes of combinationsnoun: farmhouse ; verb: English
understand ; adjective: twenty one ; adverb: herewith ; preposition: English
into ; pronoun: someone ; conjunction: because ; interjection: good English
grief It is also a gradual process as evidenced by English
the sequence of to day to day today Of much English
more interest however are the common words used in English English
that were once compounds but are not easily recognized as English
such today Let us reveal their dual disposition: Alone in English
Middle English is al `all' + one `one' If one English
is by himself he she or it is alone The English
word is generally associated with being lonely Atom is from English
the Greek a `not' + temnein `cut ' The atom English
was named before it was split Around B C Democritus English
theorized that a thing could be divided and divided until English
it became so small it could no longer be divided English
The theory was largely shelved for two thousand years until English
several physicists produced theories which led to the fact that English
the atom could be split Because of this atom is English
a misnomer today Atone comes from the Middle English at English
`at' + on `one ' The term is used largely English
in the Christian sense of Jesus dying to atone for English
the sins of man; his death reconciled made one  English
God and man Barn is compounded from the Old English English
words beren `barley' + ern `house ' The barn was English
the building for storing barley Since Anglo Saxon times the English
word has gone through a process of generalization whereby it English
has taken on a wider range of meaning Chair is English
a Greek compound of kata `down' + hedra `sit seat English
' An appropriate name it is for the object in English
which we sit ourselves down to rest Copy is a English
blend of the prefix co `with' + Latin opia `abundance English
' Before the invention of the printing press manuscripts had English
to be copied by hand Since a second copy exceeded English
the first by one hundred percent it was considered an English
abundance Daisy is a combination of the Old English words English
called because it opens in morning and closes at night English
or because of its eyelike shape Denim is a French English
compound In the older days of France several towns produced English
serge a material for making clothing Of all the towns English
the serge de Nmes was the finest Denim is from English
de `from' + Nmes the town Dozen is a mathematically English
compounded word from the Latin duo `two' + decem `ten English
' Two plus ten equals twelve in any language Enemy English
is a combination of the Latin in `not' + amicus English
`friend ' and is thus a doublet with inimical That English
enemy could be related to amiable is more than a English
little ironic Garlic is compounded from the Old English gar English
`spear ' and lac `leek ' Garlic is a member English
of the family of leeks which is related to the English
onion Its blades are its spears  The Old English English
' combine to make lady Apparently the first kneaders of English
bread were ladies Lariat is compounded from the Spanish la English
`the' + reata `lasso ' Even though lariat contains its English
own Spanish article when we imported it into English we English
added another the English the to create a literal the English
la reata `the the lasso ' and we never think English
of it as redundancy None is the combined Old English English
`eat ' Overating is a prerequisite for becoming obese Two English
micron `small' which form omicron the smaller o of the English
Greek alphabet Stirrup has been compounded from the Old English English
of rope and were probably used for ascending objects other English
than horses Windows is compounded from the Icelandic words vindr English
`wind' + auga `eye ' a window being the eye English
of a house Because they are shortsome reduced to only English

Bauerls writes interestingly about the recent proliferation of one letter English
words [XIV ; XV ] One hopes he will continue English
his annual chronicle Although he didn't draw the conclusion explicitly English
real life and his examples make it clear that OLWs English
are used mainly as surrogates for romance and where there's English
a difference that matters sex For example in the OLW English
lexicon when two peoplesometimes but not always a man and English
a womanagree that they Lword one another they often enter English
into one of the Cwords which leads perhaps eventually to English
the M word which in turn authorizes them to F English
word with the sanction of church and state But the English
implication that OLWs are newjust because they now appear routinely English
in comic strips and on televisionis misguided Thirty one years English
ago in a song for The Music Man called The English

Bodenheim's Harlem Slang Maxwell Bodenheim is no longer the cat's English
pajamas If he was once something of a cult figure English
in Chicago and later in New York City's Greenwich Village English
he is no longer of much interest to any readerexcept English
perhaps to some stray dissertation student or to some crime English
reporter dredging up the gruesome details surrounding his violent death English
So much for the vicissitudes of poetic fame Back in English
however when Bodenheim was coming into his own as a English
literary maverick New York publisher Horace Liveright issued his novel English
Naked on Roller Skates The title is a grabber but English
the book itself would be anathema to feminists since it English
features a heroine who wishes to be beaten and degraded: English
Listen Terryany man can beat up a girl's body That's English
no trick I want an A number one guaranteed bastard English
I want him to beat my heart and beat my English
brain I want him to hurt me so I'll get English
wise I want him to lug me everywhere All the English

I want to meet the coldest womenthe women who get English
their diamonds and cars and then start to bawl about English
how sad and unlucky they've been I want to run English
into everybody just once They say a girl can't do English
it They say she runs into a smashup every time English
Well believe me she'll smash up in a village cupboard English
too if she can't hide herself and settle down That's English
a lot of newspaper hokum Today Bodenheim's novel might be English
of interest to students of the English language because of English
its use of slang Indeed Bodenheim appends to his book English
a short glossary of Harlem words used in the course English
of the novel I take the liberty of reprinting the English
glossary here because some of the terms are far from English
common  chippy hootch and century are perhaps the more English
familiar and many are not included in standard dictionaries of English
slang: acecray outcray putting the ace on the bottom of English

his muscle over reach himself wraps or skins or strips English
dollars Bodenheim adds a note: Most of the above listed English
terms are peculiar to Harlem but some of them are English
also used by whites in other sections  Only a English
third of the terms have found their way into The English
Dictionary of American Slang compiled and edited by Harold Wentworth English
and Stuart Berg Flexner Thomas Y Crowell  or Robert English
Chapman's New Dictionary of American Slang Harper & Row  English
Also Went worth Flexner and Chapman both cite the term English
the leather as meaning a kick but they date the English
term from citing a passage from Damon Runyon: he would English
give his fallen foe what we called `the leather ' English
meaning a few boots abaft the ears and spareribs  English
Bodenheim's glossary indicates the term was popular long before As English
for hamburger down meaning to `take it easy ' could English
there be any relationship between that term and the hamburger English
cited by both Chapman and Went worth Flexner? Hamburger means English
a `prize fighter who is badly beaten' or a `bum'both English
persons who are taking it easy  Indeed Bodenheim's list English
might be a source of enlightenment and delight to curators English
of American slang and is commended to their attention Of English
Course Cuthbert Recently I found in one of those files English
in which for many years I have been systematically losing English
things a magazine clipping from many years ago which points English
out that the formal language of a century and more English
past can lead to misunderstandings today It offers a case English
in point from one of the volumes of The Lives English
of the Saints a massive work written between and by English
Sabine Baring Gould   the English clergyman who is English
best remembered as the author of the hymn Onward Christian English
Soldiers  Here is what he had to say about English
Saint Cuthbert an English monk who became Bishop of Lindisfarne English
and who died in the year : No saint of English
his time or country had more frequent or affectionate intercourse English
than Cuthbert with the nuns whose numbers and influence were English
daily increasing among the Anglo saxons and especially in Northumberland English
I wasn't quite sure about the clipping so I checked English
the work itself in our public libraryand that's what it English
gives Bearing Gould a compulsive writer was a man of English
Victorian delicacy In one of his novels he mentioned certain English
heavily frilled cotton investitures of the lower limbs and elsewhere English
referred to the bloomer arrangement in the nether latitude  English
Anyway this sent me to the big Oxford where I English
found about a column and a half on intercourse As English
a noun it was first used of trade dealings between English
people of different localities Originally spelt entercourse it comes from English
the French entrecours `commerce ' which is from the Latin English
intercursus also `commerce' Soon it came to denote `communion between English
persons' and `that which is spiritual or unseen ' I English
vaguely remember a hymn I heard and perhaps helped sing English
that contains the phrase intercourse divine  As early as English
the word was used with apparent sexual signification by Thomas English
Malthus the parson and economist who is remembered for his English
Essay on the Principle of Population: An illicit intercourse between English
the sexes  But that use apparently was rare in English
those times I do not know when the word standing English
alone came into common use with an explicit sexual sense English
In the th century the word was also a verb: English
`to run through run across To have intercourse with ' English
Now back to Cuthbert the saint Ivor Brown in one English
of his delightful books on words Random Words  writes English
that Cuthbert had been an honored English name but that English
somehow during the  war it ceased to be a English
name and became an insult and was used of slackers English
who evaded military service Brown does not know how that English
happened This use of the name as a derogatory noun English
is given in both the Supplements to the OED and English
in the recent one Seventy two churches in Britain were English
named for Cuthbert Kirkcudbright `Church of Cuthbert' the name of English
a small former Scottish county and its main town is English
pronounced kir KOO breewhich Brown reports is said by the English

many different views on the point of the Vietnam war English
 those military personnel other than the Vietnamese operating ships English

is interesting to wonder what percentage actually are Russian that English
is from the state province S S R  of English
Russia The Soviet government has the problem of balancing the English
widely diverse needs and values of people from states or English
republics within a military bureaucracy It is my wholly unsubstantiated English
guess that the majority of Soviet personnel in Vietnam are English
in fact not Russian Paula Van Gelder's Poetic Licenses [XIV English

Fountain's engaging biography of Frazier Another Man's Poison Globe Pequot English
Press Chester CT Duende [XV ] may be absent in English
Italian and French as Mr Bria assures us but it English
is alive and prospering in Portuguese It has the original English
meaning a `sprite or hobgoblin that plays tricks especially at English
night in people's houses; a poltergeist ' There is a English
term in English for a tennis player reaching a height English
for a brief stretch or longer when he cannot miss English
and tennis people call it zoning I have not heard English
it used in other cases but when used it seems English
to equal tener duende I do not know whether that English
use of duende has reached Portuguese speakers in Brazil or English
Portugal but if it has not it probably will soon English
because so many Portuguese speakers are bilingual in Spanish In English
his delightful article Onomatoplazia [XV ] Chester Delaney writes  English
analysand was obviously derived directly from the nd marker of English
the active gerund in Latin which suggests the therapist active English
agent rather than the patient  Not so Mr Delaney English
is a victim of the confusion so often experienced by English
Latin students between the gerund which is a neuter noun English
active in meaning and the gerundive which is an adjective English
of similar form but passive in meaning Analysand like several English
nd words in English is derived from the gerundive and English
so means `a person to be analyzed ' Similarly reverend English
means `one who is to be revered ' ordinand is English
`one who is to be ordained'; an old standby of English
crossword compilers deodand is a `thing to be given to English
God ' and legend is `something to be read ' English
We use in their original Latin forms addenda and corrigenda English
meaning `things to be added corrected ' An interesting example English
of a derivative from the passive gerundive that has acquired English
a quasi active meaning is reprimand from reprimendus `one who English
is to be repressed ' In the course of its English
transfer to English through French it has become `a severe English
or formal rebuke ' i e the act of repressing English
Charles Delaney asks for further examples of onomatoplazia Here are English
two which misled me for years: hogget Nothing to do English
with pigs It is the term applied to a one English
year old sheep passerine It ought to be a bird English
of passage but it isn't It is a bird that English
perches An amusing example of this kind of semantic confusion English
will be found in Chapter XX of Aldous Huxley's Crome English
Yellow From boyhood the romantic poetically inclined hero Denis Stone English
found the word carminative particularly evocative It suggested the warmth English
the rosiness  carmine  of wine and flesh and English
by association with carmen carminis the idea of singing To English
find out that it meant `able to cure flatulence' was English
the death of youth and innoncence All the same in English
one respect Denis was right The word like charm  English
is indeed associated with singing and goes back to the English
time when men attempted to cure the ills of the English
flesh by incantation And to return to Mr Delaney swimmingly English
is associated with aquatic sports: with a smooth gliding movement English
says OED No confusion there I would suggest Onomatoplazia struck English
a delightful chord for me When I first began to English
study German it took a while to learn that Gift English
was not something one wanted for Christmas and that Mist English
was not cool and dewy but warm and smelly Here English
are a few of my favourites in English coupled with English
their deceitful meanings: demarch a retreat narthex a high exalted English
church official suffragan someone barely tolerated pleonasm a rapidly growing English
cancer afflatus a fart The words divine afflatus thus create English
an unforgettable image jejune like a gumdrop A salute to English
Delaney for creating onomatoplazia a much needed new word Safire English
should take note Re the linguistic division in Belgium [XIV English

advertising: reuseable disposable plates draft beer in a bottle in English
store warehouse sale boneless bar b p ribs In his English
winning essay [XIV ] on Shakespeare's extensive use of legal English
language Mr D S Bland makes one error for sure English
and if I read him rightly yet another in the English
same spot He refers to those chilling lines at the English
end of III ii where Macbeth invokes Night's cover for English
the intended murder of Banquo Bland slips up when he English
states it is to enable him to proceed on his English
path to the murder of Duncan  Your Third Prize English
notwithstanding Duncan was murdered several pages earlier The serious error English
is in his apparently thinking that Macbeth's Cancel and tear English
to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale! relates English
to night destroying daylight in the sense that darkness will English
cancel the daylight's `bond ' whatever that may be No English
the bond here is Banquo's lease on life and his English
fatherhood with great alluding to the supernatural powers of the English
witches especially the Third Witch It is she who had English
addressed Macbeth in I ii as that shalt be king English
hereafter  A few lines later she confounds him by English
prophesying that Banquo shall get kings  Macbeth harps on English
this mystery after the witches vanish muttering to Banquo in English
a tone of envious wonderment Your children shall be kings English
 In the tyrant's mind that great bond really means English
Banquo Fleance both subject to the bonded prophecy uttered by English
the Third Witch The father can beget new offspring safe English
from Macbeth's hand; the son is the palpable threat Both English
their lives must be snuffed out immediately or the usurper English
will remain paralyzed kept pale by that unearthly promise He English
views either of them as the instrument the bond of English
his not being able to pass on the crown to English
a successor of his choosing or of his subsequent begetting English
Yes Night will devour Day but Macbeth's significant meaning here English
is: under cover of darknessin reckless defiance of weird authorityhe English
will have his black agents eliminate the bonded progenitor of English
Scottish kings along with his only progeny As it turns English
out Fleance escapes to fulfill the prophecy of Banquo begetting English
a line of kings Macbeth's action to have the bond English
canceled becomes null and void True to the terms of English
the indenture set forth by its guarantors that great bond English
will suffer no default In answer to Mr Anson's first English
point I can only say mea culpa It is the English
kind of silly slip that we are all guilty of English
making from time to time Witness Chester Delaney [XV ] English
who attributes lowing herd to Oliver Goldsmith instead of to English
Thomas Gray As for Macbeth's great bond this is a English
crux over which commentators have argued for years Mr Anson's English
interpretation is one that has been advanced before and is English
dealt with for example in Kenneth Muir's Arden edition My English
own reading of the passage turns as much on the English
word pale as on bond but the word limit set English
by the essay competition forced me to be rather elliptical English
Briefly I interpret bond as being implicit in God's first English
act of creationthe separation of night from day In praying English
for its cancellation Macbeth is unwittingly asking that chaos should English
come again as indeed it does within the world of English
the tragedy until the restoration of order through Macbeth's death English
and the assumption of the crown by Malcolm But my English
main object in choosing the passage was to illustrate the English
way in which Shakespeare could move from the literal to English
the metaphorical or metaphysical in his use of a legal English
term From that point of view the differing interpretations Mr English
Anson and I read into the passage are of secondary English
importance Henry Henn's Me Gook [XIV ] prompts me to English
ask which Chinese language his Asians were speaking If we English
say the Chinese language we refer of course to the English
written language Chinese speak Mandarin Cantonese Fukienese Hakka etc tongues English
Le 24 fvrier 1815, la vigie de Notre-Dame de la French
Garde signala le trois-mts le _Pharaon_, venant de Smyrne, Trieste French
et Naples. Comme d'habitude, un pilote ctier partit aussitt du French
port, rasa le chteau d'If, et alla aborder le navire French
entre le cap de Morgion et l'le de Rion. Aussitt, French
comme d'habitude encore, la plate-forme du fort Saint-Jean s'tait couverte French
de curieux; car c'est toujours une grande affaire  Marseille French
que l'arrive d'un btiment, surtout quand ce btiment, comme le French
_Pharaon_, a t construit, gr, arrim sur les chantiers de French
la vieille Phoce, et appartient  un armateur de la French
ville. Cependant ce btiment s'avanait; il avait heureusement franchi le French
dtroit que quelque secousse volcanique a creus entre l'le de French
Calasareigne et l'le de Jaros; il avait doubl Pomgue, et French
il s'avanait sous ses trois huniers, son grand foc et French
sa brigantine, mais si lentement et d'une allure si triste, French
que les curieux, avec cet instinct qui pressent un malheur, French
se demandaient quel accident pouvait tre arriv  bord. Nanmoins French
les experts en navigation reconnaissaient que si un accident tait French
arriv, ce ne pouvait tre au btiment lui-mme; car il French
s'avanait dans toutes les conditions d'un navire parfaitement gouvern: son French
ancre tait en mouillage, ses haubans de beaupr dcrochs; et French
prs du pilote, qui s'apprtait  diriger le _Pharaon_ par French
l'troite entre du port de Marseille, tait un jeune homme French
au geste rapide et  l'oeil actif, qui surveillait chaque French
mouvement du navire et rptait chaque ordre du pilote. La French
vague inquitude qui planait sur la foule avait particulirement atteint French
un des spectateurs de l'esplanade de Saint-Jean, de sorte qu'il French
ne put attendre l'entre du btiment dans le port; il French
sauta dans une petite barque et ordonna de ramer au-devant French
du _Pharaon_, qu'il atteignit en face de l'anse de la French
Rserve. En voyant venir cet homme, le jeune marin quitta French
son poste  ct du pilote, et vint, le chapeau French
 la main, s'appuyer  la muraille du btiment. C'tait French
un jeune homme de dix-huit  vingt ans, grand, svelte, French
avec de beaux yeux noirs et des cheveux d'bne; il French
y avait dans toute sa personne cet air calme et French
de rsolution particulier aux hommes habitus depuis leur enfance  French
lutter avec le danger. Ah! c'est vous, Dants! cria l'homme French
 la barque; qu'est-il donc arriv, et pourquoi cet air French
de tristesse rpandu sur tout votre bord? Un grand malheur, French
monsieur Morrel! rpondit le jeune homme, un grand malheur, pour French
moi surtout:  la hauteur de Civita-Vecchia, nous avons perdu French
ce brave capitaine Leclre. Et le chargement? demanda vivement l'armateur. French
Il est arriv  bon port, monsieur Morrel, et je French
crois que vous serez content sous ce rapport; mais ce French
pauvre capitaine Leclre.... Que lui est-il donc arriv? demanda l'armateur French
d'un air visiblement soulag; que lui est-il donc arriv,  French
ce brave capitaine? Il est mort. Tomb  la mer? French
Non, monsieur; mort d'une fivre crbrale, au milieu d'horribles souffrances. French
Puis, se retournant vers ses hommes: Hol h! dit-il, chacun French
 son poste pour le mouillage! L'quipage obit. Au mme French
instant, les huit ou dix matelots qui le composaient s'lancrent French
les uns sur les coutes, les autres sur les bras, French
les autres aux drisses, les autres aux hallebas des focs, French
enfin les autres aux cargues des voiles. Le jeune marin French
jeta un coup d'oeil nonchalant sur ce commencement de manoeuvre, French
et, voyant que ses ordres allaient s'excuter, il revint  French
son interlocuteur. Et comment ce malheur est-il donc arriv? continua French
l'armateur, reprenant la conversation o le jeune marin l'avait quitte. French
Mon Dieu, monsieur, de la faon la plus imprvue: aprs French
une longue conversation avec le commandant du port, le capitaine French
Leclre quitta Naples fort agit; au bout de vingt-quatre heures, French
la fivre le prit; trois jours aprs, il tait mort.... French
Nous lui avons fait les funrailles ordinaires, et il repose, French
dcemment envelopp dans un hamac, avec un boulet de trente-six French
aux pieds et un  la tte,  la hauteur French
de l'le d'El Giglio. Nous rapportons  sa veuve sa French
croix d'honneur et son pe. C'tait bien la peine, continua French
le jeune homme avec un sourire mlancolique, de faire dix French
ans la guerre aux Anglais pour en arriver  mourir, French
comme tout le monde, dans son lit. Dame! que voulez-vous, French
monsieur Edmond, reprit l'armateur qui paraissait se consoler de plus French
en plus, nous sommes tous mortels, et il faut bien French
que les anciens fassent place aux nouveaux, sans cela il French
n'y aurait pas d'avancement; et du moment que vous m'assurez French
que la cargaison.... Est en bon tat, monsieur Morrel, je French
vous en rponds. Voici un voyage que je vous donne French
le conseil de ne point escompter pour 25.000 francs de French
bnfice. Puis, comme on venait de dpasser la tour ronde: French
Range  carguer les voiles de hune, le foc et French
la brigantine! cria le jeune marin; faites penaud! L'ordre s'excuta French
avec presque autant de promptitude que sur un btiment de French
guerre. Amne et cargue partout! Au dernier commandement, toutes les French
voiles s'abaissrent, et le navire s'avana d'une faon presque insensible, French
ne marchant plus que par l'impulsion donne. Et maintenant, si French
vous voulez monter, monsieur Morrel, dit Dants voyant l'impatience de French
l'armateur, voici votre comptable, M. Danglars, qui sort de sa French
cabine, et qui vous donnera tous les renseignements que vous French
pouvez dsirer. Quant  moi, il faut que je veille French
au mouillage et que je mette le navire en deuil. French
L'armateur ne se le fit pas dire deux fois. Il French
saisit un cble que lui jeta Dants, et, avec une French
dextrit qui et fait honneur  un homme de mer, French
il gravit les chelons clous sur le flanc rebondi du French
btiment, tandis que celui-ci, retournant  son poste de second, French
cdait la conversation  celui qu'il avait annonc sous le French
nom de Danglars, et qui, sortant de sa cabine, s'avanait French
effectivement au-devant de l'armateur. Le nouveau venu tait un homme French
de vingt-cinq  vingt-six ans, d'une figure assez sombre, obsquieux French
envers ses suprieurs, insolent envers ses subordonns: aussi, outre son French
titre d'agent comptable, qui est toujours un motif de rpulsion French
pour les matelots, tait-il gnralement aussi mal vu de l'quipage French
qu'Edmond Dants au contraire en tait aim. Eh bien, monsieur French
Morrel, dit Danglars, vous savez le malheur, n'est-ce pas? Oui, French
oui, pauvre capitaine Leclre! c'tait un brave et honnte homme! French
Et un excellent marin surtout, vieilli entre le ciel et French
l'eau, comme il convient  un homme charg des intrts French
d'une maison aussi importante que maison Morrel et fils, rpondit French
Danglars. Mais, dit l'armateur, suivant des yeux Dants qui cherchait French
son mouillage, mais il me semble qu'il n'y a pas French
besoin d'tre si vieux marin que vous le dites, Danglars, French
pour connatre son mtier, et voici notre ami Edmond qui French
fait le sien, ce me semble, en homme qui n'a French
besoin de demander des conseils  personne. Oui, dit Danglars French
en jetant sur Dants un regard oblique o brilla un French
clair de haine, oui, c'est jeune, et cela ne doute French
de rien.  peine le capitaine a-t-il t mort qu'il French
a pris le commandement sans consulter personne, et qu'il nous French
a fait perdre un jour et demi  l'le d'Elbe French
au lieu de revenir directement  Marseille. Quant  prendre French
le commandement du navire, dit l'armateur, c'tait son devoir comme French
second; quant  perdre un jour et demi  l'le French
d'Elbe, il a eu tort;  moins que le navire French
n'ait eu quelque avarie  rparer. Le navire se portait French
comme je me porte, et comme je dsire que vous French
vous portiez, monsieur Morrel; et cette journe et demie a French
t perdue par pur caprice, pour le plaisir d'aller  French
terre, voil tout. Dants, dit l'armateur se retournant vers le French
jeune homme, venez donc ici. Pardon, monsieur, dit Dants, je French
suis  vous dans un instant. Puis s'adressant  l'quipage: French
Mouille! dit-il. Aussitt l'ancre tomba, et la chane fila avec French
bruit. Dants resta  son poste, malgr la prsence du French
pilote, jusqu' ce que cette dernire manoeuvre ft termine; puis French
alors: Abaissez la flamme  mi-mt, mettez le pavillon en French
berne, croisez les vergues! Vous voyez, dit Danglars, il se French
croit dj capitaine, sur ma parole. Et il l'est de French
fait, dit l'armateur. Oui, sauf votre signature et celle de French
votre associ, monsieur Morrel. Dame! pourquoi ne le laisserions-nous pas French
 ce poste? dit l'armateur. Il est jeune, je le French
sais bien, mais il me parat tout  la chose, French
et fort expriment dans son tat. Un nuage passa sur French
le front de Danglars. Pardon, monsieur Morrel, dit Dants en French
s'approchant; maintenant que le navire est mouill, me voil tout French
 vous: vous m'avez appel, je crois? Danglars fit un French
pas en arrire. Je voulais vous demander pourquoi vous vous French
tiez arrt  l'le d'Elbe? Je l'ignore, monsieur; c'tait pour French
accomplir un dernier ordre du capitaine Leclre, qui, en mourant, French
m'avait remis un paquet pour le grand marchal Bertrand. L'avez-vous French
donc vu, Edmond? Qui? Le grand marchal? Oui. Morrel regarda French
autour de lui, et tira Dants  part. Et comment French
va l'Empereur? demanda-t-il vivement. Bien, autant que j'aie pu en French
juger par mes yeux. Vous avez donc vu l'Empereur aussi? French
Il est entr chez le marchal pendant que j'y tais. French
Et vous lui avez parl? C'est--dire que c'est lui qui French
m'a parl, monsieur, dit Dants en souriant. Et que vous French
a-t-il dit? Il m'a fait des questions sur le btiment, French
sur l'poque de son dpart pour Marseille, sur la route French
qu'il avait suivie et sur la cargaison qu'il portait. Je French
crois que s'il et t vide, et que j'en eusse French
t le matre, son intention et t de l'acheter; mais French
je lui ai dit que je n'tais que simple second, French
et que le btiment appartenait  la maison Morrel et French
fils. Ah! ah! a-t-il dit, je la connais. Les Morrel French
sont armateurs de pre en fils, et il y avait French
un Morrel qui servait dans le mme rgiment que moi French
lorsque j'tais en garnison  Valence. C'est pardieu vrai! s'cria French
l'armateur tout joyeux; c'tait Policar Morrel, mon oncle, qui est French
devenu capitaine. Dants, vous direz  mon oncle que l'Empereur French
s'est souvenu de lui, et vous le verrez pleurer, le French
vieux grognard. Allons, allons, continua l'armateur en frappant amicalement sur French
l'paule du jeune homme, vous avez bien fait, Dants, de French
suivre les instructions du capitaine Leclre et de vous arrter French
 l'le d'Elbe, quoique, si l'on savait que vous avez French
remis un paquet au marchal et caus avec l'Empereur, cela French
pourrait vous compromettre. En quoi voulez-vous, monsieur, que cela me French
compromette? dit Dants: je ne sais pas mme ce que French
je portais, et l'Empereur ne m'a fait que les questions French
qu'il et faites au premier venu. Mais, pardon, reprit Dants, French
voici la sant et la douane qui nous arrivent; vous French
permettez, n'est-ce pas? Faites, faites, mon cher Dants. Le jeune French
homme s'loigna, et, comme il s'loignait, Danglars se rapprocha. Eh French
bien, demanda-t-il, il parat qu'il vous a donn de bonnes French
raisons de son mouillage  Porto-Ferrajo? D'excellentes, mon cher monsieur French
Danglars. Ah! tant mieux, rpondit celui-ci, car c'est toujours pnible French
de voir un camarade qui ne fait pas son devoir. French
Dants a fait le sien, rpondit l'armateur, et il n'y French
a rien  dire. C'tait le capitaine Leclre qui lui French
avait ordonn cette relche.  propos du capitaine Leclre, ne French
vous a-t-il pas remis une lettre de lui? Qui? Dants. French
 moi, non! En avait-il donc une? Je croyais qu'outre French
le paquet, le capitaine Leclre lui avait confi une lettre. French
De quel paquet voulez-vous parler, Danglars? Mais de celui que French
Dants a dpos en passant  Porto-Ferrajo? Comment savez-vous qu'il French
avait un paquet  dposer  Porto-Ferrajo? Danglars rougit. Je French
passais devant la porte du capitaine qui tait entrouverte, et French
je lui ai vu remettre ce paquet et cette lettre French
 Dants. Il ne m'en a point parl, dit l'armateur; French
mais s'il a cette lettre, il me la remettra. Danglars French
rflchit un instant. Alors, monsieur Morrel, je vous prie, dit-il, French
ne parlez point de cela  Dants; je me serai French
tromp. En ce moment, le jeune homme revenait; Danglars s'loigna. French
Eh bien, mon cher Dants, tes-vous libre? demanda l'armateur. Oui, French
monsieur. La chose n'a pas t longue. Non, j'ai donn French
aux douaniers la liste de marchandises; et quant  la French
consigne, elle avait envoy avec le pilote ctier un homme French
 qui j'ai remis nos papiers. Alors, vous n'avez plus French
rien  faire ici? Dants jeta un regard rapide autour French
de lui. Non, tout est en ordre, dit-il. Vous pouvez French
donc alors venir dner avec nous? Excusez-moi, monsieur Morrel, excusez-moi, French
je vous prie, mais je dois ma premire visite  French
mon pre. Je n'en suis pas moins reconnaissant de l'honneur French
que vous me faites. C'est juste, Dants, c'est juste. Je French
sais que vous tes bon fils. Et... demanda Dants avec French
une certaine hsitation, et il se porte bien, que vous French
sachiez, mon pre? Mais je crois que oui, mon cher French
Edmond, quoique je ne l'aie pas aperu. Oui, il se French
tient enferm dans sa petite chambre. Cela prouve au moins French
qu'il n'a manqu de rien pendant votre absence. Dants sourit. French
Mon pre est fier, monsieur, et, et-il manqu de tout, French
je doute qu'il et demand quelque chose  qui que French
ce soit au monde, except  Dieu. Eh bien, aprs French
cette premire visite, nous comptons sur vous. Excusez-moi encore, monsieur French
Morrel, mais aprs cette premire visite, j'en ai une seconde French
qui ne me tient pas moins au coeur. Ah! c'est French
vrai, Dants; j'oubliais qu'il y a aux Catalans quelqu'un qui French
doit vous attendre avec non moins d'impatience que votre pre: French
c'est la belle Mercds. Dants sourit. Ah! ah! dit l'armateur, French
cela ne m'tonne plus, qu'elle soit venue trois fois me French
demander des nouvelles du _Pharaon_. Peste! Edmond, vous n'tes point French
 plaindre, et vous avez l une jolie matresse! Ce French
n'est point ma matresse, monsieur, dit gravement le jeune marin: French
c'est ma fiance. C'est quelquefois tout un, dit l'armateur en French
riant. Pas pour nous, monsieur, rpondit Dants. Allons, allons, mon French
cher Edmond, continua l'armateur, que je ne vous retienne pas; French
vous avez assez bien fait mes affaires pour que je French
vous donne tout loisir de faire les vtres. Avez-vous besoin French
d'argent? Non, monsieur; j'ai tous mes appointements du voyage, c'est--dire French
prs de trois mois de solde. Vous tes un garon French
rang, Edmond. Ajoutez que j'ai un pre pauvre, monsieur Morrel. French
Oui, oui, je sais que vous tes un bon fils. French
Allez donc voir votre pre: j'ai un fils aussi, et French
j'en voudrais fort  celui qui, aprs un voyage de French
trois mois, le retiendrait loin de moi. Alors, vous permettez? French
dit le jeune homme en saluant. Oui, si vous n'avez French
rien de plus  me dire. Non. Le capitaine Leclre French
ne vous a pas, en mourant, donn une lettre pour French
moi? Il lui et t impossible d'crire, monsieur; mais cela French
me rappelle que j'aurai un cong de quinze jours  French
vous demander. Pour vous marier? D'abord; puis pour aller  French
Paris. Bon, bon! vous prendrez le temps que vous voudrez, French
Dants; le temps de dcharger le btiment nous prendra bien French
six semaines, et nous ne nous remettrons gure en mer French
avant trois mois.... Seulement, dans trois mois, il faudra que French
vous soyez l. Le _Pharaon_, continua l'armateur en frappant sur French
l'paule du jeune marin, ne pourrait pas repartir sans son French
capitaine. Sans son capitaine! s'cria Dants les yeux brillants de French
joie; faites bien attention  ce que vous dites l, French
monsieur, car vous venez de rpondre aux plus secrtes esprances French
de mon coeur. Votre intention serait-elle de me nommer capitaine French
du _Pharaon_? Si j'tais seul, je vous tendrais la main, French
mon cher Dants, et je vous dirais: C'est fait. Mais French
j'ai un associ, et vous savez le proverbe italien: _Che French
a compagne a padrone_. Mais la moiti de la besogne French
est faite au moins, puisque sur deux voix vous en French
avez dj une. Rapportez-vous-en  moi pour avoir l'autre, et French
je ferai de mon mieux. Oh! monsieur Morrel, s'cria le French
jeune marin, saisissant, les larmes aux yeux, les mains de French
l'armateur; monsieur Morrel, je vous remercie, au nom de mon French
pre et de Mercds. C'est bien, c'est bien, Edmond, il French
y a un Dieu au ciel pour les braves gens, French
que diable! Allez voir votre pre, allez voir Mercds, et French
revenez me trouver aprs. Mais vous ne voulez pas que French
je vous ramne  terre? Non, merci; je reste  French
rgler mes comptes avec Danglars. Avez-vous t content de lui French
pendant le voyage? C'est selon le sens que vous attachez French
 cette question, monsieur. Si c'est comme bon camarade, non, French
car je crois qu'il ne m'aime pas depuis le jour French
o j'ai eu la btise,  la suite d'une petite French
querelle que nous avions eue ensemble, de lui proposer de French
nous arrter dix minutes  l'le de Monte-Cristo pour vider French
cette querelle; proposition que j'avais eu tort de lui faire, French
et qu'il avait eu, lui, raison de refuser. Si c'est French
comme comptable que vous me faites cette question je crois French
qu'il n'y a rien  dire et que vous serez French
content de la faon dont sa besogne est faite. Mais, French
demanda l'armateur, voyons, Dants, si vous tiez capitaine du _Pharaon_, French
garderiez-vous Danglars avec plaisir? Capitaine ou second, monsieur Morrel, rpondit French
dit Dants, j'aurai toujours les plus grands gards pour ceux French
qui possderont la confiance de mes armateurs. Allons, allons, Dants, French
je vois qu'en tout point vous tes un brave garon. French
Que je ne vous retienne plus: allez, car je vois French
que vous tes sur des charbons. J'ai donc mon cong? French
demanda Dants. Allez, vous dis-je. Vous permettez que je prenne French
votre canot? Prenez. Au revoir, monsieur Morrel, et mille fois French
merci. Au revoir, mon cher Edmond, bonne chance! Le jeune French
marin sauta dans le canot, alla s'asseoir  la poupe, French
et donna l'ordre d'aborder  la Canebire. Deux matelots se French
penchrent aussitt sur leurs rames, et l'embarcation glissa aussi rapidement French
qu'il est possible de le faire, au milieu des mille French
barques qui obstruent l'espce de rue troite qui conduit, entre French
deux ranges de navires, de l'entre du port au quai French
d'Orlans. L'armateur le suivit des yeux en souriant, jusqu'au bord, French
le vit sauter sur les dalles du quai, et se French
perdre aussitt au milieu de la foule bariole qui, de French
cinq heures du matin  neuf heures du soir, encombre French
cette fameuse rue de la Canebire, dont les Phocens modernes French
sont si fiers, qu'ils disent avec le plus grand srieux French
du monde et avec cet accent qui donne tant de French
caractre  ce qu'ils disent: Si Paris avait la Canebire, French
Paris serait un petit Marseille. En se retournant, l'armateur vit French
derrire lui Danglars, qui, en apparence, semblait attendre ses ordres, French
mais qui, en ralit, suivait comme lui le jeune marin French
du regard. Seulement, il y avait une grande diffrence dans French
l'expression de ce double regard qui suivait le mme homme. French
II Le pre et le fils. Laissons Danglars, aux prises French
avec le gnie de la haine, essayer de souffler contre French
son camarade quelque maligne supposition  l'oreille de l'armateur, et French
suivons Dants, qui, aprs avoir parcouru la Canebire dans toute French
sa longueur, prend la rue de Noailles, entre dans une French
petite maison situe du ct gauche des Alles de Meilhan, French
monte vivement les quatre tages d'un escalier obscur, et, se French
retenant  la rampe d'une main, comprimant de l'autre les French
battements de son coeur, s'arrte devant une porte entre baille, French
qui laisse voir jusqu'au fond d'une petite chambre. Cette chambre French
tait celle qu'habitait le pre de Dants. La nouvelle de French
l'arrive du _Pharaon_ n'tait encore parvenue au vieillard, qui s'occupait, French
mont sur une chaise,  palissader d'une main tremblante quelques French
capucines mles de clmatites, qui montaient en grimpant le long French
du treillage de sa fentre. Tout  coup il se French
sentit prendre  bras-le-corps, et une voix bien connue s'cria French
derrire lui: Mon pre, mon bon pre! Le vieillard jeta French
un cri et se retourna; puis, voyant son fils, il French
se laissa aller dans ses bras, tout tremblant et tout French
ple. Qu'as-tu donc, pre? s'cria le jeune homme inquiet; serais-tu French
malade? Non, non, mon cher Edmond, mon fils, mon enfant, French
non; mais je ne t'attendais pas, et la joie, le French
saisissement de te revoir ainsi  l'improviste... mon Dieu! il French
me semble que je vais mourir! Eh bien, remets-toi donc, French
pre! c'est moi, bien moi! On dit toujours que la French
joie ne fait pas mal, et voil pourquoi je suis French
entr ici sans prparation. Voyons, souris-moi, au lieu de me French
regarder comme tu le fais, avec des yeux gars. Je French
reviens et nous allons tre heureux. Ah! tant mieux, garon! French
reprit le vieillard, mais comment allons-nous tre heureux? tu ne French
me quittes donc plus? Voyons, conte-moi ton bonheur. Que le French
Seigneur me pardonne, dit le jeune homme, de me rjouir French
d'un bonheur fait avec le deuil d'une famille! Mais Dieu French
sait que je n'eusse pas dsir ce bonheur; il arrive, French
et je n'ai pas la force de m'en affliger: le French
brave capitaine Leclre est mort, mon pre, et il est French
probable que, par la protection de M. Morrel, je vais French
avoir sa place. Comprenez-vous, mon pre? capitaine  vingt ans! French
avec cent louis d'appointements et une part dans les bnfices! French
n'est-ce pas plus que ne pouvait vraiment l'esprer un pauvre French
matelot comme moi? Oui, mon fils, oui, en effet, dit French
le vieillard, c'est heureux. Aussi je veux que du premier French
argent que je toucherai vous ayez une petite maison, avec French
un jardin pour planter vos clmatites, vos capucines et vos French
chvrefeuilles.... Mais, qu'as-tu donc, pre, on dirait que tu te French
trouves mal? Patience, patience! ce ne sera rien. Et, les French
forces manquant au vieillard, il se renversa en arrire. Voyons! French
voyons! dit le jeune homme, un verre de vin, mon French
pre; cela vous ranimera; o mettez-vous votre vin? Non, merci, French
ne cherche pas; je n'en ai pas besoin, dit le French
vieillard essayant de retenir son fils. Si fait, si fait, French
pre, indiquez-moi l'endroit. Et il ouvrit deux ou trois armoires. French
Inutile... dit le vieillard, il n'y a plus de vin. French
Comment, il n'y a plus de vin! dit en plissant French
 son tour Dants, regardant alternativement les joues creuses et French
blmes du vieillard et les armoires vides, comment, il n'y French
a plus de vin! Auriez-vous manqu d'argent, mon pre? Je French
n'ai manqu de rien, puisque te voil, dit le vieillard. French
Cependant, balbutia Dants en essuyant la sueur qui coulait de French
son front, cependant je vous avais laiss deux cents francs, French
il y a trois mois, en partant. Oui, oui, Edmond, French
c'est vrai; mais tu avais oubli en partant une petite French
dette chez le voisin Caderousse; il me l'a rappele, en French
me disant que si je ne payais pas pour toi French
il irait se faire payer chez M. Morrel. Alors, tu French
comprends, de peur que cela te ft du tort.... Eh French
bien? Eh bien, j'ai pay, moi. Mais, s'cria Dants, c'tait French
cent quarante francs que je devais  Caderousse! Oui, balbutia French
le vieillard. Et vous les avez donns sur les deux French
cent francs que je vous avais laisss? Le vieillard fit French
un signe de tte. De sorte que vous avez vcu French
trois mois avec soixante francs! murmura le jeune homme. Tu French
sais combien il me faut peu de chose, dit vieillard. French
Oh! mon Dieu, mon Dieu, pardonnez-moi! s'cria Edmond en se French
jetant  genoux devant le bonhomme. Que fais-tu donc? Oh! French
vous m'avez dchir le coeur. Bah! te voil, dit le French
vieillard en souriant; maintenant tout est oubli, car tout est French
bien. Oui, me voil, dit le jeune homme, me voil French
avec un bel avenir et un peu d'argent. Tenez, pre, French
dit-il, prenez, prenez, et envoyez chercher tout de suite quelque French
chose. Et il vida sur la table ses poches, qui French
contenaient une douzaine de pices d'or, cinq ou six cus French
de cinq francs et de la menue monnaie. Le visage French
du vieux Dants s'panouit.  qui cela? dit-il. Mais,  French
moi!...  toi!...  nous!... Prends, achte des provisions, sois French
heureux, demain il y en a d'autres. Doucement, doucement, dit French
le vieillard en souriant; avec ta permission, j'userai modrment de French
la bourse: on croirait, si l'on me voyait acheter trop French
de choses  la fois, que j'ai t oblig d'attendre French
le retour pour les acheter. Fais comme tu voudras; mais, French
avant toutes choses, prends une servante, pre; je ne veux French
pas que tu restes seul. J'ai du caf de contrebande French
et d'excellent tabac dans un petit coffre de la cale, French
tu l'auras ds demain. Mais chut! voici quelqu'un. C'est Caderousse French
qui aura appris ton arrive, et qui vient sans doute French
te faire son compliment de bon retour. Bon, encore des French
lvres qui disent une chose tandis que le coeur en French
pense une autre, murmura Edmond; mais, n'importe, c'est un voisin French
qui nous a rendu service autrefois, qu'il soit le bienvenu. French
En effet, au moment o Edmond achevait la phrase  French
voix basse, on vit apparatre encadre par la porte du French
palier, la tte noire et barbue de Caderousse. C'tait un French
homme de vingt-cinq  vingt-six ans; il tenait  sa French
main un morceau de drap, qu'en sa qualit de tailleur French
il s'apprtait  changer en un revers d'habit. Eh! te French
voil donc revenu, Edmond? dit-il avec un accent marseillais des French
plus prononcs et avec un large sourire qui dcouvrait ses French
dents blanches comme de l'ivoire. Comme vous voyez, voisin Caderousse, French
et prt  vous tre agrable en quelque chose que French
ce soit, rpondit Dants en dissimulant mal sa froideur sous French
cette offre de service. Merci, merci; heureusement, je n'ai besoin French
de rien, et ce sont mme quelquefois les autres qui French
ont besoin de moi. Dants fit un mouvement. Je ne French
te dis pas cela pour toi, garon; je t'ai prt French
de l'argent, tu me l'as rendu; cela se fait entre French
bons voisins, et nous sommes quittes. On n'est jamais quitte French
envers ceux qui nous ont obligs, dit Dants, car lorsqu'on French
ne leur doit plus l'argent, on leur doit la reconnaissance. French
 quoi bon parler de cela! Ce qui est pass French
est pass. Parlons de ton heureux retour, garon. J'tais donc French
all comme cela sur le port pour rassortir du drap French
marron, lorsque je rencontrai l'ami Danglars. Toi,  Marseille? Eh French
oui, tout de mme, me rpondit-il. Je te croyais  French
Smyrne. J'y pourrais tre, car j'en reviens. Et Edmond, o French
est-il donc, le petit? Mais chez son pre, sans doute, French
rpondit Danglars; et alors je suis venu, continua Caderousse, pour French
avoir le plaisir de serrer la main  un ami. French
Ce bon Caderousse, dit le vieillard, il nous aime tant. French
Certainement que je vous aime, et que je vous estime French
encore, attendu que les honntes gens sont rares! Mais il French
parat que tu deviens riche, garon? continua le tailleur en French
jetant un regard oblique sur la poigne d'or et d'argent French
que Dants avait dpose sur la table. Le jeune homme French
remarqua l'clair de convoitise qui illumina les yeux noirs de French
son voisin. Eh! mon Dieu! dit-il ngligemment, cet argent n'est French
point  moi; je manifestais au pre la crainte qu'il French
n'et manqu de quelque chose en mon absence, et pour French
me rassurer, il a vid sa bourse sur la table. French
Allons, pre, continua Dants, remettez cet argent dans votre tirelire; French
 moins que le voisin Caderousse n'en ait besoin  French
son tour, auquel cas il est bien  son service. French
Non pas, garon, dit Caderousse, je n'ai besoin de rien, French
et, Dieu merci l'tat nourrit son homme. Garde ton argent, French
garde: on n'en a jamais de trop; ce qui n'empche French
pas que je ne te sois oblig de ton offre French
comme si j'en profitais. C'tait de bon coeur, dit Dants. French
Je n'en doute pas. Eh bien, te voil donc au French
mieux avec M. Morrel, clin que tu es? M. Morrel French
a toujours eu beaucoup de bont pour moi, rpondit Dants. French
En ce cas, tu as tort de refuser son dner. French
Comment, refuser son dner? reprit le vieux Dants; il t'avait French
donc invit  dner? Oui, mon pre, reprit Edmond en French
souriant de l'tonnement que causait  son pre l'excs de French
l'honneur dont il tait l'objet. Et pourquoi donc as-tu refus, French
fils? demanda le vieillard. Pour revenir plus tt prs de French
vous, mon pre, rpondit le jeune homme; j'avais hte de French
vous voir. Cela l'aura contrari, ce bon M. Morrel, reprit French
Caderousse; et quand on vise  tre capitaine, c'est un French
tort que de contrarier son armateur. Je lui ai expliqu French
la cause de mon refus, reprit Dants, et il l'a French
comprise, je l'espre. Ah! c'est que, pour tre capitaine, il French
faut un peu flatter ses patrons. J'espre tre capitaine sans French
cela, rpondit Dants. Tant mieux, tant mieux! cela fera plaisir French
 tous les anciens amis, et je sais quelqu'un l-bas, French
derrire la citadelle de Saint-Nicolas, qui n'en sera pas fch. French
Mercds? dit le vieillard. Oui, mon pre, reprit Dants, et, French
avec permission, maintenant que je vous ai vu, maintenant que French
je sais que vous vous portez bien et que vous French
avez tout ce qu'il vous faut, je vous demanderai la French
permission d'aller faire visite aux Catalans. Va, mon enfant, dit French
le vieux Dants, et que Dieu te bnisse dans ta French
femme comme il m'a bni dans mon fils. Sa femme! French
dit Caderousse; comme vous y allez, pre Dants! elle ne French
l'est pas encore, ce me semble! Non; mais, selon toute French
probabilit, rpondit Edmond, elle ne tardera pas  le devenir. French
N'importe, n'importe, dit Caderousse, tu as bien fait de te French
dpcher, garon. Pourquoi cela? Parce que la Mercds est une French
belle fille, et que les belles filles ne manquent pas French
d'amoureux; celle-l surtout, ils la suivent par douzaines. Vraiment, dit French
Edmond avec un sourire sous lequel perait une lgre nuance French
d'inquitude. Oh! oui, reprit Caderousse, et de beaux partis mme; French
mais, tu comprends, tu vas tre capitaine, on n'aura garde French
de te refuser, toi! Ce qui veut dire, reprit Dants French
avec un sourire qui dissimulait mal son inquitude, que si French
je n'tais pas capitaine.... Eh! eh! fit Caderousse. Allons, allons, French
dit le jeune homme, j'ai meilleure opinion que vous des French
femmes en gnral, et de Mercds en particulier, et, j'en French
suis convaincu, que je sois capitaine ou non, elle me French
restera fidle. Tant mieux! tant mieux! dit Caderousse, c'est toujours, French
quand on va se marier, une bonne chose que d'avoir French
la foi, mais, n'importe; crois-moi, garon, ne perds pas de French
temps  aller lui annoncer ton arrive et  lui French
faire part de tes esprances. J'y vais , dit Edmond. French
Il embrassa son pre, salua Caderousse d'un signe et sortit. French
Caderousse resta un instant encore; puis, prenant cong du vieux French
Dants, il descendit  son tour et alla rejoindre Danglars, French
qui l'attendait au coin de la rue Senac. Eh bien, French
dit Danglars, l'as-tu vu? Je le quitte, dit Caderousse. Et French
t'a-t-il parl de son esprance d'tre capitaine? Il en parle French
comme s'il l'tait dj. Patience! dit Danglars, il se presse French
un peu trop, ce me semble. Dame! il parat que French
la chose lui est promise par M. Morrel. De sorte French
qu'il est bien joyeux? C'est--dire qu'il en est insolent; il French
m'a dj fait ses offres de service comme si c'tait French
un grand personnage; il m'a offert de me prter de French
l'argent comme s'il tait un banquier. Et vous avez refus? French
Parfaitement; quoique j'eusse bien pu accepter, attendu que c'est moi French
qui lui ai mis  la main les premires pices French
blanches qu'il a manies. Mais maintenant M. Dants n'aura plus French
besoin de personne, il va tre capitaine. Bah! dit Danglars, French
il ne l'est pas encore. Ma foi, ce serait bien French
fait qu'il ne le ft pas, dit Caderousse, ou sans French
cela il n'y aura plus moyen de lui parler. Que French
si nous le voulons bien, dit Danglars, il restera ce French
qu'il est, et peut-tre mme deviendra moins qu'il n'est. Que French
dis-tu? Rien, je me parle  moi-mme. Et il est French
toujours amoureux de la belle Catalane? Amoureux fou. Il y French
est all; mais ou je me trompe fort, ou il French
aura du dsagrment de ce ct-l. Explique-toi.  quoi bon? French
C'est plus important que tu ne crois. Tu n'aimes pas French
Dants, hein? Je n'aime pas les arrogants. Eh bien, alors! French
dis-moi ce que tu sais relativement  la Catalane. Je French
ne sais rien de bien positif; seulement j'ai vu des French
choses qui me font croire, comme je te l'ai dit, French
que le futur capitaine aura du dsagrment aux environs du French
chemin des Vieilles-Infirmeries. Qu'as-tu vu? allons, dis. Eh bien, j'ai French
vu que toutes les fois que Mercds vient en ville, French
elle y vient accompagne d'un grand gaillard de Catalan  French
l'oeil noir,  la peau rouge, trs brun, trs ardent, French
et qu'elle appelle _mon_ cousin. Ah! vraiment! et crois-tu que French
ce cousin lui fasse la cour? Je le suppose: que French
diable peut faire un grand garon de vingt et un French
ans  une belle fille de dix-sept? Et tu dis French
que Dants est all aux Catalans? Il est parti devant French
moi. Si nous allions du mme ct, nous nous arrterions French
 la Rserve, et, tout en buvant un verre de French
vin de La Malgue, nous attendrions des nouvelles. Et qui French
nous en donnera? Nous serons sur la route, et nous French
verrons sur le visage de Dants ce qui se sera French
pass. Allons, dit Caderousse; mais c'est toi qui paies? Certainement, French
rpondit Danglars. Et tous deux s'acheminrent d'un pas rapide vers French
l'endroit indiqu. Arrivs l, ils se firent apporter une bouteille French
et deux verres. Le pre Pamphile venait de voir passer French
Dants il n'y avait pas dix minutes. Certains que Dants French
tait aux Catalans, ils s'assirent sous le feuillage naissant des French
platanes et des sycomores, dans les branches desquels une bande French
joyeuse d'oiseaux chantaient un des premiers beaux jours de printemps. French
III Les Catalans.  cent pas de l'endroit o les French
deux amis, les regards  l'horizon et l'oreille au guet, French
sablaient le vin ptillant de La Malgue, s'levait, derrire une French
butte nue et ronge par le soleil et le mistral, French
le village des Catalans. Un jour, une colonie mystrieuse partit French
de l'Espagne et vint aborder  la langue de terre French
o elle est encore aujourd'hui. Elle arrivait on ne savait French
d'o et parlait une langue inconnue. Un des chefs, qui French
entendait le provenal, demanda  la commune de Marseille de French
leur donner ce promontoire nu et aride, sur lequel ils French
venaient, comme les matelots antiques, de tirer leurs btiments. La French
demande lui fut accorde, et trois mois aprs, autour des French
douze ou quinze btiments qui avaient amen ces bohmiens de French
la mer, un petit village s'levait. Ce village construit d'une French
faon bizarre et pittoresque, moiti maure, moiti espagnol, est celui French
que l'on voit aujourd'hui habit par des descendants de ces French
hommes, qui parlent la langue de leurs pres. Depuis trois French
ou quatre sicles, ils sont encore demeurs fidles  ce French
petit promontoire, sur lequel ils s'taient abattus, pareils  une French
bande d'oiseaux de mer, sans se mler en rien  French
la population marseillaise, se mariant entre eux, et ayant conserv French
les moeurs et le costume de leur mre patrie, comme French
ils en ont conserv le langage. Il faut que nos French
lecteurs nous suivent  travers l'unique rue de ce petit French
village, et entrent avec nous dans une de ces maisons French
auxquelles le soleil a donn, au-dehors, cette belle couleur feuille French
morte particulire aux monuments du pays, et, au-dedans, une couche French
de badigeon, cette teinte blanche qui forme le seul ornement French
des posadas espagnoles. Une belle jeune fille aux cheveux noirs French
comme le jais, aux yeux velouts comme ceux de la French
gazelle, tenait debout, adosse  une cloison, et froissait entre French
ses doigts effils et d'un dessin antique une bruyre innocente French
dont elle arrachait les fleurs, et dont les dbris jonchaient French
dj le sol; en outre, ses bras nus jusqu'au coude, French
ses bras brunis, mais qui semblaient models sur ceux de French
la Vnus d'Arles, frmissaient d'une sorte d'impatience fbrile, et elle French
frappait la terre de son pied souple et cambr, de French
sorte que l'on entrevoyait la forme pure, fire et hardie French
de sa jambe, emprisonne dans un bas de coton rouge French
 coins gris et bleus.  trois pas d'elle, assis French
sur une chaise qu'il balanait d'un mouvement saccad, appuyant son French
coude  un vieux meuble vermoulu, un grand garon de French
vingt  vingt-deux ans la regardait d'un air o se French
combattaient l'inquitude et le dpit; ses yeux interrogeaient, mais le French
regard ferme et fixe de la jeune fille dominait son French
interlocuteur. Voyons, Mercds, disait le jeune homme, voici Pques qui French
va revenir, c'est le moment de faire une noce, rpondez-moi! French
Je vous ai rpondu cent fois, Fernand, et il faut French
en vrit que vous soyez bien ennemi de vous-mme pour French
m'interroger encore! Eh bien, rptez-le encore, je vous en supplie, French
rptez-le encore pour que j'arrive  le croire. Dites-moi pour French
la centime fois que vous refusez mon amour, qu'approuvait votre French
mre; faites-moi bien comprendre que vous vous jouez de mon French
bonheur, que ma vie et ma mort ne sont rien French
pour vous. Ah! mon Dieu, mon Dieu! avoir rv dix French
ans d'tre votre poux, Mercds, et perdre cet espoir qui French
tait le seul but de ma vie! Ce n'est pas French
moi du moins qui vous ai jamais encourag dans cet French
espoir, Fernand, rpondit Mercds; vous n'avez pas une seule coquetterie French
 me reprocher  votre gard. Je vous ai toujours French
dit: Je vous aime comme un frre, mais n'exigez jamais French
de moi autre chose que cette amiti fraternelle, car mon French
coeur est  un autre. Vous ai-je toujours dit cela, French
Fernand? Oui, je le sais bien, Mercds, rpondit le jeune French
homme; oui, vous vous tes donn, vis--vis de moi, le French
cruel mrite de la franchise; mais oubliez-vous que c'est parmi French
les Catalans une loi sacre de se marier entre eux? French
Vous vous trompez, Fernand, ce n'est pas une loi, c'est French
une habitude, voil tout; et, croyez-moi, n'invoquez pas cette habitude French
en votre faveur. Vous tes tomb  la conscription, Fernand; French
la libert qu'on vous laisse, c'est une simple tolrance; d'un French
moment  l'autre vous pouvez tre appel sous les drapeaux. French
Une fois soldat, que ferez-vous de moi, c'est--dire d'une pauvre French
fille orpheline, triste, sans fortune, possdant pour tout bien une French
cabane presque en ruine, o pendent quelques filets uss, misrable French
hritage laiss par mon pre  ma mre et par French
ma mre  moi? Depuis un an qu'elle est morte, French
songez donc, Fernand, que je vis presque de la charit French
publique! Quelquefois vous feignez que je vous suis utile, et French
cela pour avoir le droit de partager votre poche avec French
moi; et j'accepte, Fernand, parce que vous tes le fils French
d'un frre de mon pre, parce que nous avons t French
levs ensemble et plus encore parce que, par-dessus tout, cela French
vous ferait trop de peine si je vous refusais. Mais French
je sens bien que ce poisson que je vais vendre French
et dont je tire l'argent avec lequel j'achte le chanvre French
que je file, je sens bien, Fernand, que c'est une French
charit. Et qu'importe, Mercds, si, pauvre et isole que vous French
tes, vous me convenez ainsi mieux que la fille du French
plus fier armateur ou du plus riche banquier de Marseille! French
 nous autres, que nous faut-il? Une honnte femme et French
une bonne mnagre. O trouverais-je mieux que vous sous ces French
deux rapports? Fernand, rpondit Mercds en secouant la tte, on French
devient mauvaise mnagre et on ne peut rpondre de rester French
honnte femme lorsqu'on aime un autre homme que son mari. French
Contentez-vous de mon amiti, car, je vous le rpte, c'est French
tout ce que je puis vous promettre, et je ne French
promets que ce que je suis sre de pouvoir donner. French
Oui, je comprends, dit Fernand; vous supportez patiemment votre misre, French
mais vous avez peur de la mienne. Eh bien, Mercds, French
aim de vous, je tenterai la fortune; vous me porterez French
bonheur, et je deviendrai riche: je puis tendre mon tat French
de pcheur; je puis entrer comme commis dans un comptoir; French
je puis moi-mme devenir marchand! Vous ne pouvez rien tenter French
de tout cela, Fernand; vous tes soldat, et si vous French
restez aux Catalans, c'est parce qu'il n'y a pas de French
guerre. Demeurez donc pcheur; ne faites point de rves qui French
vous feraient paratre la ralit plus terrible encore, et contentez-vous French
de mon amiti, puisque je ne puis vous donner autre French
chose. Eh bien, vous avez raison, Mercds, je serai marin; French
j'aurai, au lieu du costume de nos pres que vous French
mprisez, un chapeau verni, une chemise raye et une veste French
bleue avec des ancres sur les boutons. N'est-ce point ainsi French
qu'il faut tre habill pour vous plaire? Que voulez-vous dire? French
demanda Mercds en lanant un regard imprieux, que voulez-vous dire? French
Je ne vous comprends pas. Je veux dire, Mercds, que French
vous n'tes si dure et si cruelle pour moi que French
parce que vous attendez quelqu'un qui est ainsi vtu. Mais French
celui que vous attendez est inconstant peut-tre, et, s'il ne French
l'est pas, la mer l'est pour lui. Fernand, s'cria Mercds, French
je vous croyais bon et je me trompais! Fernand, vous French
tes un mauvais coeur d'appeler  l'aide de votre jalousie French
les colres de Dieu! Eh bien, oui, je ne m'en French
cache pas, j'attends et j'aime celui que vous dites, et French
s'il ne revient pas, au lieu d'accuser cette inconstance que French
vous invoquez, vous, je dirai qu'il est mort en m'aimant. French
Le jeune Catalan fit un geste de rage. Je vous French
comprends, Fernand: vous vous en prendrez  lui de ce French
que je ne vous aime pas; vous croiserez votre couteau French
catalan contre son poignard!  quoi cela vous avancera-t-il?  French
perdre mon amiti si vous tes vaincu,  voir mon French
amiti se changer en haine si vous tes vainqueur. Croyez-moi, French
chercher querelle  un homme est un mauvais moyen de French
plaire  la femme qui aime cet homme. Non, Fernand, French
vous ne vous laisserez point aller ainsi  vos mauvaises French
penses. Ne pouvant m'avoir pour femme, vous vous contenterez de French
m'avoir pour amie et pour soeur; et d'ailleurs, ajouta-t-elle, les French
yeux troubls et mouills de larmes, attendez, attendez, Fernand: vous French
l'avez dit tout  l'heure, la mer est perfide, et French
il y a dj quatre mois qu'il est parti; depuis French
quatre mois j'ai compt bien des temptes! Fernand demeura impassible; French
il ne chercha pas  essuyer les larmes qui roulaient French
sur les joues de Mercds; et cependant, pour chacune de French
ces larmes, il et donn un verre de son sang; French
mais ces larmes coulaient pour un autre. Il se leva, French
fit un tour dans la cabane et revint, s'arrta devant French
Mercds, l'oeil sombre et les poings crisps. Voyons, Mercds, dit-il, French
encore une fois rpondez: est-ce bien rsolu? J'aime Edmond Dants, French
dit froidement la jeune fille, et nul autre qu'Edmond ne French
sera mon poux. Et vous l'aimerez toujours? Tant que je French
vivrai. Fernand baissa la tte comme un homme dcourag, poussa French
un soupir qui ressemblait  un gmissement; puis tout  French
coup relevant le front, les dents serres et les narines French
entrouvertes: Mais s'il est mort? S'il est mort, je mourrai. French
Mais s'il vous oublie? Mercds! cria une voix joyeuse au-dehors French
de la maison, Mercds! Ah! s'cria la jeune fille en French
rougissant de joie et en bondissant d'amour, tu vois bien French
qu'il ne m'a pas oublie, puisque le voil! Et elle French
s'lana vers la porte, qu'elle ouvrit en s'criant:  moi, French
Edmond! me voici. Fernand, ple et frmissant, recula en arrire French
comme fait un voyageur  la vue d'un serpent, et French
rencontrant sa chaise, il y retomba assis. Edmond et Mercds French
taient dans les bras l'un de l'autre. Le soleil ardent French
de Marseille, qui pntrait  travers l'ouverture de la porte, French
les inondait d'un flot de lumire. D'abord ils ne virent French
rien de ce qui les entourait. Un immense bonheur les French
isolait du monde, et ils ne parlaient que par ces French
mots entrecoups qui sont les lans d'une joie si vive French
qu'ils semblent l'expression de la douleur. Tout  coup Edmond French
aperut la figure sombre de Fernand, qui se dessinait dans French
l'ombre, ple et menaante; par un mouvement dont il ne French
se rendit pas compte lui-mme, le jeune Catalan tenait la French
main sur le couteau pass  sa ceinture. Ah! pardon, French
dit Dants en fronant le sourcil  son tour, je French
n'avais pas remarqu que nous tions trois. Puis, se tournant French
vers Mercds: Qui est ce monsieur? demanda-t-il. Monsieur sera votre French
meilleur ami, Dants, car c'est mon ami  moi, c'est French
mon cousin, c'est mon frre; c'est Fernand; c'est--dire l'homme qu'aprs French
vous, Edmond, j'aime le plus au monde; ne le reconnaissez-vous French
pas? Ah! si fait , dit Edmond. Et, sans abandonner French
Mercds, dont il tenait la main serre dans une des French
siennes, il tendit avec un mouvement de cordialit son autre French
main au Catalan. Mais Fernand, loin de rpondre  ce French
geste amical, resta muet et immobile comme une statue. Alors French
Edmond promena son regard investigateur de Mercds, mue et tremblante, French
 Fernand, sombre et menaant. Ce seul regard lui apprit French
tout. La colre monta  son front. Je ne savais French
pas venir avec tant de hte chez vous Mercds, pour French
y trouver un ennemi. Un ennemi! s'cria Mercds avec un French
regard de courroux  l'adresse de son cousin; un ennemi French
chez moi, dis-tu, Edmond! Si je croyais cela, je te French
prendrais sous le bras et je m'en irais  Marseille, French
quittant la maison pour n'y plus jamais rentrer. L'oeil de French
Fernand lana un clair. Et s'il t'arrivait malheur, mon Edmond, French
continua-t-elle avec ce mme flegme implacable qui prouvait  Fernand French
que la jeune fille avait lu jusqu'au plus profond de French
sa sinistre pense, s'il t'arrivait malheur, je monterais sur le French
cap de Morgion, et je me jetterais sur les rochers French
la tte la premire. Fernand devint affreusement ple. Mais tu French
t'es tromp, Edmond, poursuivit-elle, tu n'as point d'ennemi ici; il French
n'y a que Fernand, mon frre, qui va te serrer French
la main comme  un ami dvou. Et  ces French
mots, la jeune fille fixa son visage imprieux sur le French
Catalan, qui, comme s'il et t fascin par ce regard, French
s'approcha lentement d'Edmond et tendit la main. Sa haine, pareille French
 une vague impuissante, quoique furieuse, venait se briser contre French
l'ascendant que cette femme exerait sur lui. Mais  peine French
eut-il touch la main d'Edmond, qu'il sentit qu'il avait fait French
tout ce qu'il pouvait faire, et qu'il s'lana hors de French
la maison. Oh! s'criait-il en courant comme un insens en French
noyant ses mains dans ses cheveux, oh! qui me dlivrera French
donc de cet homme? Malheur  moi! malheur  moi! French
Eh! le Catalan! eh! Fernand! o cours-tu? dit une voix. French
Le jeune homme s'arrta tout court, regarda autour de lui, French
et aperut Caderousse attabl avec Danglars sous un berceau de French
feuillage. Eh! dit Caderousse, pourquoi ne viens-tu pas? Es-tu donc French
si press que tu n'aies pas le temps de dire French
bonjour aux amis? Surtout quand ils ont encore une bouteille French
presque pleine devant eux , ajouta Danglars. Fernand regarda les French
deux hommes d'un air hbt, et ne rpondit rien. Il French
semble tout penaud, dit Danglars, poussant du genou Caderousse: est-ce French
que nous nous serions tromps, et qu'au contraire de ce French
que nous avions prvu, Dants triompherait? Dame! il faut voir French
, dit Caderousse. Et se retournant vers le jeune homme: French
Eh bien, voyons, le Catalan, te dcides-tu? dit-il. Fernand essuya French
la sueur qui ruisselait de son front et entra lentement French
sous la tonnelle, dont l'ombrage sembla rendre un peu de French
calme  ses sens et la fracheur un peu de French
bien-tre  son corps puis. Bonjour, dit-il, vous m'avez appel, French
n'est-ce pas? Et il tomba plutt qu'il ne s'assit sur French
un des siges qui entouraient la table. Je t'ai appel French
parce que tu courais comme un fou, et que j'ai French
eu peur que tu n'allasses te jeter  la mer, French
dit en riant Caderousse. Que diable, quand on a des French
amis, c'est non seulement pour leur offrir un verre de French
vin, mais encore pour les empcher de boire trois ou French
quatre pintes d'eau. Fernand poussa un gmissement qui ressemblait  French
un sanglot et laissa tomber sa tte sur ses deux French
poignets, poss en croix sur la table. Eh bien, veux-tu French
que je te dise, Fernand, reprit Caderousse, entamant l'entretien avec French
cette brutalit grossire des gens du peuple auxquels la curiosit French
fait oublier toute diplomatie; eh bien, tu as l'air d'un French
amant dconfit! Et il accompagna cette plaisanterie d'un gros rire. French
Bah! rpondit Danglars, un garon taill comme celui-l n'est pas French
fait pour tre malheureux en amour; tu te moques, Caderousse. French
Non pas, reprit celui-ci; coute plutt comme il soupire. Allons, French
allons, Fernand, dit Caderousse, lve le nez et rponds-nous: ce French
n'est pas aimable de ne pas rpondre aux amis qui French
nous demandent des nouvelles de notre sant. Ma sant va French
bien, dit Fernand crispant ses poings mais sans lever la French
tte. Ah! vois-tu Danglars, dit Caderousse en faisant signe de French
l'oeil  son ami, voici la chose: Fernand, que tu French
vois, et qui est un bon et brave Catalan, un French
des meilleurs pcheurs de Marseille, est amoureux d'une belle fille French
qu'on appelle Mercds; mais malheureusement il parat que la belle French
fille, de son cot, est amoureuse du second du _Pharaon_; French
et, comme le _Pharaon_ est entr aujourd'hui mme dans le French
port, tu comprends? Non, je ne comprends pas, dit Danglars. French
Le pauvre Fernand aura reu son cong, continua Caderousse. Eh French
bien, aprs? dit Fernand relevant la tte et regardant Caderousse, French
en homme qui cherche quelqu'un sur qui faire tomber sa French
colre; Mercds ne dpend de personne? n'est-ce pas? et elle French
est bien libre d'aimer qui elle veut. Ah! si tu French
le prends ainsi, dit Caderousse, c'est autre chose! Moi, je French
te croyais un Catalan; et l'on m'avait dit que les French
Catalans n'taient pas hommes  se laisser supplanter par un French
rival; on avait mme ajout que Fernand surtout tait terrible French
dans sa vengeance. Fernand sourit avec piti. Un amoureux n'est French
jamais terrible, dit-il. Le pauvre garon! reprit Danglars feignant de French
plaindre le jeune homme du plus profond de son coeur. French
Que veux-tu? il ne s'attendait pas  voir revenir ainsi French
Dants tout  coup; il le croyait peut-tre mort, infidle, French
qui sait? Ces choses-l sont d'autant plus sensibles qu'elles nous French
arrivent tout  coup. Ah! ma foi, dans tous les French
cas, dit Caderousse qui buvait tout en parlant et sur French
lequel le vin fumeux de La Malgue commenait  faire French
son effet, dans tous les cas, Fernand n'est pas le French
seul que l'heureuse arrive de Dants contrarie, n'est-ce pas, Danglars? French
Non, tu dis vrai, et j'oserais presque dire que cela French
lui portera malheur. Mais n'importe, reprit Caderousse en versant un French
verre de vin  Fernand, et en remplissant pour la French
huitime ou dixime fois son propre verre tandis que Danglars French
avait  peine effleur le sien; n'importe, en attendant il French
pouse Mercds, la belle Mercds; il revient pour cela, du French
moins. Pendant ce temps, Danglars enveloppait d'un regard perant le French
jeune homme, sur le coeur duquel les paroles de Caderousse French
tombaient comme du plomb fondu. Et  quand la noce? French
demanda-t-il. Oh! elle n'est pas encore faite! murmura Fernand. Non, French
mais elle se fera, dit Caderousse, aussi vrai que Dants French
sera le capitaine du _Pharaon_, n'est-ce pas, Danglars? Danglars tressaillit French
 cette atteinte inattendue, et se retourna vers Caderousse, dont French
 son tour il tudia le visage pour voir si French
le coup tait prmdit; mais il ne lut rien que French
l'envie sur ce visage dj presque hbt par l'ivresse. Eh French
bien, dit-il en remplissant les verres, buvons donc au capitaine French
Edmond Dants, mari de la belle Catalane! Caderousse porta son French
verre  sa bouche d'une main alourdie et l'avala d'un French
trait. Fernand prit le sien et le brisa contre terre. French
Eh! eh! eh! dit Caderousse, qu'aperois-je donc l-bas, au haut French
de la butte, dans la direction des Catalans? Regarde donc, French
Fernand, tu as meilleure vue que moi; je crois que French
je commence  voir trouble, et, tu le sais, le French
vin est un tratre: on dirait deux amants qui marchent French
cte  cte et la main dans la main. Dieu French
me pardonne! ils ne se doutent pas que nous les French
voyons, et les voil qui s'embrassent! Danglars ne perdait pas French
une des angoisses de Fernand, dont le visage se dcomposait French
 vue d'oeil. Les connaissez-vous, monsieur Fernand? dit-il. Oui, rpondit French
celui-ci d'une voix sourde, c'est M. Edmond et Mlle Mercds. French
Ah! voyez-vous! dit Caderousse, et moi qui ne les reconnaissais French
pas! Oh! Dants! oh! la belle fille! venez par ici French
un peu, et dites-nous  quand la noce, car voici French
M. Fernand qui est si entt qu'il ne veut pas French
nous le dire. Veux-tu te taire! dit Danglars, affectant de French
retenir Caderousse, qui, avec la tnacit des ivrognes, penchait hors French
du berceau; tche de te tenir debout et laisse les French
amoureux s'aimer tranquillement. Tiens, regarde M. Fernand, et prends exemple: French
il est raisonnable, lui. Peut-tre Fernand, pouss  bout, aiguillonn French
par Danglars comme le taureau par les banderilleros, allait-il enfin French
s'lancer, car il s'tait dj lev et semblait se ramasser French
sur lui-mme pour bondir sur son rival; mais Mercds, riante French
et droite, leva sa belle tte et fit rayonner son French
clair regard; alors Fernand se rappela la menace qu'elle avait French
faite, de mourir si Edmond mourait, et il retomba tout French
dcourag sur son sige. Danglars regarda successivement ces deux hommes: French
l'un abruti par l'ivresse, l'autre domin par l'amour. Je ne French
tirerai rien de ces niais-l, murmura-t-il, et j'ai grand-peur d'tre French
ici entre un ivrogne et un poltron: voici un envieux French
qui se grise avec du vin, tandis qu'il devrait s'enivrer French
de fiel; voici un grand imbcile  qui on vient French
de prendre sa matresse sous son nez et qui se French
contente de pleurer et de se plaindre comme un enfant. French
Et cependant, cela vous a des yeux flamboyants comme ces French
Espagnols, ces Siciliens et ces Calabrais, qui se vengent si French
bien; cela vous a des poings  craser une tte French
de boeuf aussi srement que le ferait la masse d'un French
boucher. Dcidment, le destin d'Edmond l'emporte; il pousera la belle French
fille, il sera capitaine et se moquera de nous;  French
moins que... un sourire livide se dessina sur les lvres French
de Danglars  moins que je ne m'en mle, ajouta-t-il. French
Hol! continuait de crier Caderousse  moiti lev et les French
poings sur la table, hol! Edmond! tu ne vois donc French
pas les amis, ou est-ce que tu es dj trop French
fier pour leur parler? Non, mon cher Caderousse, rpondit Dants, French
je ne suis pas fier, mais je suis heureux, et French
le bonheur aveugle, je crois, encore plus que la fiert. French
 la bonne heure! voil une explication, dit Caderousse. Eh! French
bonjour, madame Dants. Mercds salua gravement. Ce n'est pas encore French
mon nom, dit-elle, et dans mon pays cela porte malheur, French
assure-t-on, d'appeler les filles du nom de leur fianc avant French
que ce fianc soit leur mari; appelez-moi donc Mercds, je French
vous prie. Il faut lui pardonner,  ce bon voisin French
Caderousse, dit Dants, il se trompe de si peu de French
chose! Ainsi, la noce va avoir lieu incessamment monsieur Dants? French
dit Danglars en saluant les deux jeunes gens. Le plus French
tt possible, monsieur Danglars; aujourd'hui tous les accords chez le French
papa Dants, et demain ou aprs-demain, au plus tard, le French
dner des fianailles, ici,  la Rserve. Les amis y French
seront, je l'espre; c'est vous dire que vous tes invit, French
monsieur Danglars; c'est te dire que tu en es, Caderousse. French
Et Fernand, dit Caderousse en riant d'un rire pteux, Fernand French
en est-il aussi? Le frre de ma femme est mon French
frre, dit Edmond, et nous le verrions avec un profond French
regret, Mercds et moi, s'carter de nous dans un pareil French
moment. Fernand ouvrit la bouche pour rpondre; mais la voix French
expira dans sa gorge, et il ne put articuler un French
seul mot. Aujourd'hui les accords, demain ou aprs-demain les fianailles... French
diable! vous tes bien press, capitaine. Danglars, reprit Edmond en French
souriant, je vous dirai comme Mercds disait tout  l'heure French
 Caderousse: ne me donnez pas le titre qui ne French
me convient pas encore, cela me porterait malheur. Pardon, rpondit French
Danglars; je disais donc simplement que vous paraissiez bien press; French
que diable! nous avons le temps: le _Pharaon_ ne se French
remettra gure en mer avant trois mois. On est toujours French
press d'tre heureux, monsieur Danglars, car lorsqu'on a souffert longtemps French
on a grand-peine  croire au bonheur. Mais ce n'est French
pas l'gosme seul qui me fait agir: il faut que French
j'aille  Paris. Ah! vraiment!  Paris: et c'est la French
premire fois que vous y allez, Dants? Oui. Vous y French
avez affaire? Pas pour mon compte: une dernire commission de French
notre pauvre capitaine Leclre  remplir; vous comprenez, Danglars, c'est French
sacr. D'ailleurs soyez tranquille, je ne prendrai que le temps French
d'aller et revenir. Oui, oui, je comprends , dit tout French
haut Danglars. Puis tout bas:  Paris, pour remettre  French
son adresse sans doute la lettre que le grand marchal French
lui a donne. Pardieu! cette lettre me fait pousser une French
ide, une excellente ide! Ah! Dants, mon ami, tu n'es French
pas encore couch au registre du _Pharaon_ sous le numro French
1. Puis se retournant vers Edmond, qui s'loignait dj: Bon French
voyage! lui cria-t-il. Merci , rpondit Edmond en retournant la French
tte et en accompagnant ce mouvement d'un geste amical. Puis French
les deux amants continurent leur route, calmes et joyeux comme French
deux lus qui montent au ciel. IV Complot. Danglars suivit French
Edmond et Mercds des yeux jusqu' ce que les deux French
amants eussent disparu  l'un des angles du fort Saint-Nicolas; French
puis, se retournant alors, il aperut Fernand, qui tait retomb French
ple et frmissant sur sa chaise, tandis que Caderousse balbutiait French
les paroles d'une chanson  boire. Ah ! mon cher French
monsieur, dit Danglars  Fernand, voil un mariage qui ne French
me parat pas faire le bonheur de tout le monde! French
Il me dsespre, dit Fernand. Vous aimiez donc Mercds? Je French
l'adorais! Depuis longtemps? Depuis que nous nous connaissons, je l'ai French
toujours aime. Et vous tes l  vous arracher les French
cheveux, au lieu de chercher remde  la chose! Que French
diable! je ne croyais pas que ce ft ainsi qu'agissaient French
les gens de votre nation. Que voulez-vous que je fasse? French
demanda Fernand. Et que sais-je, moi? Est-ce que cela me French
regarde? Ce n'est pas moi, ce me semble, qui suis French
amoureux de Mlle Mercds, mais vous. Cherchez, dit l'vangile, et French
vous trouverez. J'avais trouv dj. Quoi? Je voulais poignarder _l'homme_, French
mais la femme m'a dit que s'il arrivait malheur  French
son fianc, elle se tuerait. Bah! on dit ces choses-l, French
mais on ne les fait point. Vous ne connaissez point French
Mercds, monsieur: du moment o elle a menac, elle excuterait. French
Imbcile! murmura Danglars: qu'elle se tue ou non, que m'importe, French
pourvu que Dants ne soit point capitaine. Et avant que French
Mercds meure, reprit Fernand avec l'accent d'une immuable rsolution, je French
mourrais moi-mme. En voil de l'amour! dit Caderousse d'une voix French
de plus en plus avine; en voil, ou je ne French
m'y connais plus! Voyons, dit Danglars, vous me paraissez un French
gentil garon, et je voudrais, le diable m'emporte! vous tirer French
de peine; mais.... Oui, dit Caderousse, voyons. Mon cher, reprit French
Danglars, tu es aux trois quarts ivres: achve la bouteille, French
et tu le seras tout  fait. Bois, et ne French
te mle pas de ce que nous faisons: pour ce French
que nous faisons il faut avoir toute sa tte. Moi French
ivre? dit Caderousse, allons donc! J'en boirais encore quatre, de French
tes bouteilles, qui ne sont pas plus grandes que des French
bouteilles d'eau de Cologne! Pre Pamphile, du vin! Et pour French
joindre la preuve  la proposition, Caderousse frappa avec son French
verre sur la table. Vous disiez donc, monsieur? reprit Fernand, French
attendant avec avidit la suite de la phrase interrompue. Que French
disais-je? Je ne me le rappelle plus. Cet ivrogne de French
Caderousse m'a fait perdre le fil de mes penses. Ivrogne French
tant que tu le voudras; tant pis pour ceux qui French
craignent le vin, c'est qu'ils ont quelque mauvaise pense qu'ils French
craignent que le vin ne leur tire du coeur. Et French
Caderousse se mit  chanter les deux derniers vers d'une French
chanson fort en vogue  cette poque: _Tous les mchants French
sont buveurs d'eau. C'est bien prouv par le dluge._ Vous French
disiez, monsieur, reprit Fernand, que vous voudriez me tirer de French
peine; mais, ajoutiez-vous.... Oui, mais, ajoutais-je... pour vous tirer de French
peine il suffit que Dants n'pouse pas celle que vous French
aimez et le mariage peut trs bien manquer, ce me French
semble, sans que Dants meure. La mort seule les sparera, French
dit Fernand. Vous raisonnez comme un coquillage, mon ami, dit French
Caderousse, et voil Danglars, qui est un finaud, un malin, French
un grec, qui va vous prouver que vous avez tort. French
Prouve, Danglars. J'ai rpondu de toi. Dis-lui qu'il n'est pas French
besoin que Dants meure; d'ailleurs ce serait fcheux qu'il mourt, French
Dants. C'est un bon garon, je l'aime, moi, Dants.  French
ta sant, Dants. Fernand se leva avec impatience. Laissez-le dire, French
reprit Danglars en retenant le jeune homme, et d'ailleurs, tout French
ivre qu'il est, il ne fait point si grande erreur. French
L'absence disjoint tout aussi bien que la mort; et supposez French
qu'il y ait entre Edmond et Mercds les murailles d'une French
prison, ils seront spars ni plus ni moins que s'il French
y avait l la pierre d'une tombe. Oui, mais on French
sort de prison, dit Caderousse, qui avec les restes de French
son intelligence se cramponnait  la conversation, et quand on French
est sorti de prison et qu'on s'appelle Edmond Dants, on French
se venge. Qu'importe! murmura Fernand. D'ailleurs, reprit Caderousse, pourquoi mettrait-on French
Dants en prison? Il n'a ni vol, ni tu, ni French
assassin. Tais-toi, dit Danglars. Je ne veux pas me taire, French
moi, dit Caderousse. Je veux qu'on me dise pourquoi on French
mettrait Dants en prison. Moi, j'aime Dants.  ta sant, French
Dants! Et il avala un nouveau verre de vin. Danglars French
suivit dans les yeux atones du tailleur les progrs de French
l'ivresse, et se tournant vers Fernand: Eh bien, comprenez-vous, dit-il, French
qu'il n'y a pas besoin de le tuer? Non, certes, French
si, comme vous le disiez tout  l'heure, on avait French
le moyen de faire arrter Dants. Mais ce moyen, l'avez-vous? French
En cherchant bien, dit Danglars, on pourrait le trouver. Mais French
continua-t-il, de quoi diable! vais-je me mler l; est-ce que French
cela me regarde? Je ne sais pas si cela vous French
regarde, dit Fernand en lui saisissant le bras; mais ce French
que je sais, c'est que vous avez quelque motif de French
haine particulire contre Dants: celui qui hait lui-mme ne se French
trompe pas aux sentiments des autres. Moi, des motifs de French
haine contre Dants? Aucun, sur ma parole. Je vous ai French
vu malheureux et votre malheur m'a intress, voil tout; mais French
du moment o vous croyez que j'agis pour mon propre French
compte, adieu, mon cher ami, tirez-vous d'affaire comme vous pourrez. French
Et Danglars fit semblant de se lever  son tour. French
Non pas, dit Fernand en le retenant, restez! Peu m'importe, French
au bout du compte, que vous en vouliez  Dants, French
ou que vous ne lui en vouliez pas: je lui French
en veux, moi; je l'avoue hautement. Trouvez le moyen et French
je l'excute, pourvu qu'il n'y ait pas mort d'homme, car French
Mercds a dit qu'elle se tuerait si l'on tuait Dants. French
Caderousse, qui avait laiss tomber sa tte sur la table French
releva le front, et regardant Fernand et Danglars avec des French
yeux lourds et hbts: Tuer Dants! dit-il, qui parle ici French
de tuer Dants? je ne veux pas qu'on le tue, French
moi: c'est mon ami; il a offert ce matin de French
partager son argent avec moi, comme j'ai partag le mien French
avec lui: je ne veux pas qu'on tue Dants. Et French
qui te parle de le tuer, imbcile! reprit Danglars; il French
s'agit d'une simple plaisanterie; bois  sa sant, ajouta-t-il en French
remplissant le verre de Caderousse, et laisse-nous tranquilles. Oui, oui, French
 la sant de Dants! dit Caderousse en vidant son French
verre,  sa sant!...  sa sant!... l! Mais le French
moyen, le moyen? dit Fernand. Vous ne l'avez donc pas French
trouv encore, vous? Non, vous vous en tes charg. C'est French
vrai, reprit Danglars, les Franais ont cette supriorit sur les French
Espagnols, que les Espagnols ruminent et que les Franais inventent. French
Inventez donc alors, dit Fernand avec impatience. Garon, dit Danglars, French
une plume, de l'encre et du papier! Une plume, de French
l'encre et du papier! murmura Fernand. Oui, je suis agent French
comptable: la plume, l'encre et le papier sont mes instruments; French
et sans mes instruments je ne sais rien faire. Une French
plume, de l'encre et du papier! cria  son tour French
Fernand. Il y a ce que vous dsirez l sur French
cette table, dit le garon en montrant les objets demands. French
Donnez-les-nous alors. Le garon prit le papier, l'encre et la French
plume, et les dposa sur la table du berceau. Quand French
on pense, dit Caderousse en laissant tomber sa main sur French
le papier, qu'il y a l de quoi tuer un French
homme plus srement que si on l'attendait au coin d'un French
bois pour l'assassiner! J'ai toujours eu plus peur d'une plume, French
d'une bouteille d'encre et d'une feuille de papier que d'une French
pe ou d'un pistolet. Le drle n'est pas encore si French
ivre qu'il en a l'air, dit Danglars; versez-lui donc  French
boire, Fernand. Fernand remplit le verre de Caderousse, et celui-ci French
en vritable buveur qu'il tait, leva la main de dessus French
le papier et la porta  son verre. Le Catalan French
suivit le mouvement jusqu' ce que Caderousse, presque vaincu par French
cette nouvelle attaque, repost ou plutt laisst retomber son verre French
sur la table. Eh bien? reprit le Catalan en voyant French
que le reste de la raison de Caderousse commenait  French
disparatre sous ce dernier verre de vin. Eh bien, je French
disais donc, par exemple, reprit Danglars, que si, aprs un French
voyage comme celui que vient de faire Dants, et dans French
lequel il a touch  Naples et  l'le d'Elbe, French
quelqu'un le dnonait au procureur du roi comme agent bonapartiste.... French
Je le dnoncerai, moi! dit vivement le jeune homme. Oui; French
mais alors on vous fait signer votre dclaration, on vous French
confronte avec celui que vous avez dnonc: je vous fournis French
de quoi soutenir votre accusation, je le sais bien; mais French
Dants ne peut rester ternellement en prison, un jour ou French
l'autre il en sort, et, ce jour o il en French
sort, malheur  celui qui l'y a fait entrer! Oh! French
je ne demande qu'une chose, dit Fernand, c'est qu'il vienne French
me chercher une querelle! Oui, et Mercds! Mercds, qui vous French
prend en haine si vous avez seulement le malheur d'corcher French
l'piderme  son bien-aim Edmond! C'est juste, dit Fernand. Non, French
non, reprit Danglars, si on se dcidait  une pareille French
chose, voyez-vous, il vaudrait bien mieux prendre tout bonnement comme French
je le fais, cette plume, la tremper dans l'encre, et French
crire de la main gauche, pour que l'criture ne ft French
pas reconnue, une petite dnonciation ainsi conue. Et Danglars, joignant French
l'exemple au prcepte, crivit de la main gauche et d'une French
criture renverse, qui n'avait aucune analogie avec son criture habituelle, French
les lignes suivantes qu'il passa  Fernand, et que Fernand French
lut  demi-voix: _Monsieur le procureur du roi est prvenu, French
par un ami du trne et de la religion, que French
le nomm Edmond Dants, second du navire le_ Pharaon, _arriv French
ce matin de Smyrne, aprs avoir touch  Naples et French
 Porto-Ferrajo, a t charg, par Murat, d'une lettre pour French
l'usurpateur, et, par l'usurpateur, d'une lettre pour le comit bonapartiste French
de Paris_. _On aura la preuve de son crime en French
l'arrtant, car on trouvera cette lettre ou sur lui, ou French
chez son pre, ou dans sa cabine  bord du_ French
Pharaon.  la bonne heure, continua Danglars; ainsi votre vengeance French
aurait le sens commun, car d'aucune faon alors elle ne French
pourrait retomber sur vous, et la chose irait toute seule; French
il n'y aurait plus qu' plier cette lettre, comme je French
le fais, et  crire dessus:  Monsieur le Procureur French
royal. Tout serait dit. Et Danglars crivit l'adresse en se French
jouant. Oui, tout serait dit , s'cria Caderousse, qui par French
un dernier effort d'intelligence avait suivi la lecture, et qui French
comprenait d'instinct tout ce qu'une pareille dnonciation pourrait entraner de French
malheur; oui, tout serait dit: seulement, ce serait une infamie. French
Et il allongea le bras pour prendre la lettre. Aussi, French
dit Danglars en la poussant hors de la porte de French
sa main, aussi, ce que je dis et ce que French
je dis et ce que je fais, c'est en plaisantant; French
et, le premier, je serais bien fch qu'il arrivt quelque French
chose  Dants, ce bon Dants! Aussi, tiens... Il prit French
la lettre, la froissa dans ses mains et la jeta French
dans un coin de la tonnelle.  la bonne heure, French
dit Caderousse, Dants est mon ami, et je ne veux French
pas qu'on lui fasse de mal. Eh! qui diable y French
songe  lui faire du mal! ce n'est ni moi French
ni Fernand! dit Danglars en se levant et en regardant French
le jeune homme qui tait demeur assis, mais dont l'oeil French
oblique couvait le papier dnonciateur jet dans un coin. En French
ce cas, reprit Caderousse, qu'on nous donne du vin: je French
veux boire  la sant d'Edmond et de la belle French
Mercds. Tu n'as dj que trop bu, ivrogne, dit Danglars, French
et si tu continues tu seras oblig de coucher ici, French
attendu que tu ne pourras plus te tenir sur tes French
jambes. Moi, dit Caderousse en se levant avec la fatuit French
de l'homme ivre; moi, ne pas pouvoir me tenir sur French
mes jambes! Je parie que je monte au clocher des French
Accoules, et sans balancer encore! Eh bien, soit, dit Danglars, French
je parie, mais pour demain: aujourd'hui il est temps de French
rentrer; donne-moi donc le bras et rentrons. Rentrons, dit Caderousse, French
mais je n'ai pas besoin de ton bras pour cela. French
Viens-tu, Fernand? rentres-tu avec nous  Marseille? Non, dit Fernand, French
je retourne aux Catalans, moi. Tu as tort, viens avec French
nous  Marseille, viens. Je n'ai point besoin  Marseille, French
et je n'y veux point aller. Comment as-tu dit cela? French
Tu ne veux pas, mon bonhomme! eh bien,  ton French
aise! libert pour tout le monde! Viens, Danglars, et laissons French
monsieur rentrer aux Catalans, puisqu'il le veut. Danglars profita de French
ce moment de bonne volont de Caderousse pour l'entraner du French
ct de Marseille; seulement, pour ouvrir un chemin plus court French
et plus facile  Fernand, au lieu de revenir par French
le quai de la Rive-Neuve, il revint par la porte French
Saint-Victor. Caderousse le suivait, tout chancelant, accroch  son bras. French
Lorsqu'il eut fait une vingtaine de pas, Danglars se retourna French
et vit Fernand se prcipiter sur le papier, qu'il mit French
dans sa poche; puis aussitt, s'lanant hors de la tonnelle, French
le jeune homme tourna du ct du Pillon. Eh bien, French
que fait-il donc? dit Caderousse, il nous a menti: il French
a dit qu'il allait aux Catalans, et il va  French
la ville! Hol! Fernand! tu te trompes, mon garon! C'est French
toi qui vois trouble, dit Danglars, il suit tout droit French
le chemin des Vieilles-Infirmeries. En vrit! dit Caderousse, eh bien, French
j'aurais jur qu'il tournait  droite; dcidment le vin est French
un tratre. Allons, allons, murmura Danglars, je crois que maintenant French
la chose est bien lance, et qu'il n'y a plus French
qu' la laisser marcher toute seule. V Le repas des French
fianailles. Le lendemain fut un beau jour. Le soleil se French
leva pur et brillant, et les premiers rayons d'un rouge French
pourpre diaprrent de leurs rubis les pointes cumeuses des vagues. French
Le repas avait t prpar au premier tage de cette French
mme Rserve, avec la tonnelle de laquelle nous avons dj French
fait connaissance. C'tait une grande salle claire par cinq ou French
six fentres, au-dessus de chacune desquelles explique le phnomne qui French
pourra! tait crit le nom d'une des grandes villes de French
France. Une balustrade en bois, comme le reste du btiment, French
rgnait tout le long de ces fentres. Quoique le repas French
ne ft indiqu que pour midi, ds onze heures du French
matin, cette balustrade tait charge de promeneurs impatients. C'taient les French
marins privilgis du _Pharaon_ et quelques soldats, amis de Dants. French
Tous avaient, pour faire honneur aux fiancs, fait voir le French
jour  leurs plus belles toilettes. Le bruit circulait, parmi French
les futurs convives, que les armateurs du _Pharaon_ devaient honorer French
de leur prsence le repas de noces de leur second; French
mais c'tait de leur part un si grand honneur accord French
 Dants que personne n'osait encore y croire. Cependant Danglars, French
en arrivant avec Caderousse, confirma  son tour cette nouvelle. French
Il avait vu le matin M. Morrel lui-mme, et M. French
Morrel lui avait dit qu'il viendrait dner  la Rserve. French
En effet, un instant aprs eux, M. Morrel fit  French
son tour son entre dans la chambre et fut salu French
par les matelots du _Pharaon_ d'un hourra unanime d'applaudissements. La French
prsence de l'armateur tait pour eux la confirmation du bruit French
qui courait dj que Dants serait nomm capitaine; et comme French
Dants tait fort aim  bord, ces braves gens remerciaient French
ainsi l'armateur de ce qu'une fois par hasard son choix French
tait en harmonie avec leurs dsirs.  peine M. Morrel French
fut-il entr qu'on dpcha unanimement Danglars et Caderousse vers le French
fianc: ils avaient mission de le prvenir de l'arrive du French
personnage important dont la vue avait produit une si vive French
sensation, et de lui dire de se hter. Danglars et French
Caderousse partirent tout courant mais ils n'eurent pas fait cent French
pas, qu' la hauteur du magasin  poudre ils aperurent French
la petite troupe qui venait. Cette petite troupe se composait French
de quatre jeunes filles amies de Mercds et Catalanes comme French
elle, et qui accompagnaient la fiance  laquelle Edmond donnait French
le bras. Prs de la future marchait le pre Dants, French
et derrire eux venait Fernand avec son mauvais sourire. Ni French
Mercds ni Edmond ne voyaient ce mauvais sourire de Fernand. French
Les pauvres enfants taient si heureux qu'ils ne voyaient qu'eux French
seuls et ce beau ciel pur qui les bnissait. Danglars French
et Caderousse s'acquittrent de leur mission d'ambassadeurs; puis aprs avoir French
chang une poigne de main bien vigoureuse et bien amicale French
avec Edmond, ils allrent, Danglars prendre place prs de Fernand, French
Caderousse se ranger aux cts du pre Dants, centre de French
l'attention gnrale. Ce vieillard tait vtu de son bel habit French
de taffetas pingl, orn de larges boutons d'acier, taills  French
facettes. Ses jambes grles, mais nerveuses, s'panouissaient dans de magnifiques French
bas de coton mouchets, qui sentaient d'une lieue la contrebande French
anglaise.  son chapeau  trois cornes pendait un flot French
de rubans blancs et bleus. Enfin, il s'appuyait sur un French
bton de bois tordu et recourb par le haut comme French
un pedum antique. On et dit un de ces muscadins French
qui paradaient en 1796 dans les jardins nouvellement rouverts du French
Luxembourg et des Tuileries. Prs de lui, nous l'avons dit, French
s'tait gliss Caderousse, Caderousse que l'esprance d'un bon repas avait French
achev de rconcilier avec les Dants, Caderousse  qui il French
restait dans la mmoire un vague souvenir de ce qui French
s'tait pass la veille, comme en se rveillant le matin French
on trouve dans son esprit l'ombre du rve qu'on a French
fait pendant le sommeil. Danglars, en s'approchant de Fernand, avait French
jet sur l'amant dsappoint un regard profond. Fernand, marchant derrire French
les futurs poux, compltement oubli par Mercds, qui dans cet French
gosme juvnile et charmant de l'amour n'avait d'yeux que pour French
son Edmond. Fernand tait ple, puis rouge par bouffes subites French
qui disparaissaient pour faire place chaque fois  une pleur French
croissante. De temps en temps, il regardait du ct de French
Marseille, et alors un tremblement nerveux et involontaire faisait frissonner French
ses membres. Fernand semblait attendre ou tout au moins prvoir French
quelque grand vnement. Dants tait simplement vtu. Appartenant  la French
marine marchande, il avait un habit qui tenait le milieu French
entre l'uniforme militaire et le costume civil; et sous cet French
habit, sa bonne mine, que rehaussaient encore la joie et French
la beaut de sa fiance, tait parfaite. Mercds tait belle French
comme une de ces Grecques de Chypre ou de Cos, French
aux yeux d'bne et aux lvres de corail. Elle marchait French
de ce pas libre et franc dont marchent les Arlsiennes French
et les Andalouses. Une fille des villes et peut-tre essay French
de cacher sa joie sous un voile ou tout au French
moins sous le velours de ses paupires, mais Mercds souriait French
et regardait tous ceux qui l'entouraient, et son sourire et French
son regard disaient aussi franchement qu'auraient pu le dire ses French
paroles: Si vous tes mes amis, rjouissez-vous avec moi, car, French
en vrit, je suis bien heureuse! Ds que les fiancs French
et ceux qui les accompagnaient furent en vue de la French
Rserve, M. Morrel descendit et s'avana  son tour au-devant French
d'eux, suivi des matelots et des soldats avec lesquels il French
tait rest, et auxquels il avait renouvel la promesse dj French
faite  Dants qu'il succderait au capitaine Leclre. En le French
voyant venir, Edmond quitta le bras de sa fiance et French
le passa sous celui de M. Morrel. L'armateur et la French
jeune fille donnrent alors l'exemple en montant les premiers l'escalier French
de bois qui conduisait  la chambre o le dner French
tait servi, et qui cria pendant cinq minutes sous les French
pas pesants des convives. Mon pre, dit Mercds en s'arrtant French
au milieu de la table, vous  ma droite, je French
vous prie; quant  ma gauche, j'y mettrai celui qui French
m'a servi de frre , fit-elle avec une douceur qui French
pntra au plus profond du coeur de Fernand comme un French
coup de poignard. Ses lvres blmirent, et sous la teinte French
bistre de son mle visage on put voir encore une French
fois le sang se retirer peu  peu pour affluer French
au coeur. Pendant ce temps, Dants avait excut la mme French
manoeuvre;  sa droite il avait mis M. Morrel,  French
sa gauche Danglars; puis de la main il avait fait French
signe  chacun de se placer  sa fantaisie. Dj French
couraient autour de la table les saucissons d'Arles  la French
chair brune et au fumet accentu, les langoustes  la French
cuirasse blouissante, les prayres  la coquille rose, les oursins, French
qui semblent des chtaignes entoures de leur enveloppe piquante, les French
clovisses, qui ont la prtention de remplacer avec supriorit, pour French
les gourmets du Midi, les hutres du Nord; enfin tous French
ces hors-d'oeuvre dlicats que la vague roule sur sa rive French
sablonneuse, et que les pcheurs reconnaissants dsignent sous le nom French
gnrique de fruits de mer. Un beau silence! dit le French
vieillard en savourant un verre de vin jaune comme la French
topaze, que le pre Pamphile en personne venait d'apporter devant French
Mercds. Dirait-on qu'il y a ici trente personnes qui ne French
demandent qu' rire. Eh! un mari n'est pas toujours gai, French
dit Caderousse. Le fait est, dit Dants, que je suis French
trop heureux en ce moment pour tre gai. Si c'est French
comme cela que vous l'entendez, voisin, vous avez raison! La French
joie fait quelquefois un effet trange, elle oppresse comme la French
douleur. Danglars observa Fernand, dont la nature impressionnable absorbait et French
renvoyait chaque motion. Allons donc, dit-il, est-ce que vous craindriez French
quelque chose? il me semble, au contraire, que tout va French
selon vos dsirs! Et c'est justement cela qui m'pouvante, dit French
Dants, il me semble que l'homme n'est pas fait pour French
tre si facilement heureux! Le bonheur est comme ces palais French
des les enchantes dont les dragons gardent les portes. Il French
faut combattre pour le conqurir, et moi, en vrit, je French
ne sais en quoi j'ai mrit le bonheur d'tre le French
mari de Mercds. Le mari, le mari, dit Caderousse en French
riant, pas encore, mon capitaine; essaie un peu de faire French
le mari, et tu verras comme tu seras reu! Mercds French
rougit. Fernand se tourmentait sur sa chaise, tressaillait au moindre French
bruit, et de temps en temps essuyait de larges plaques French
de sueur qui perlaient sur son front, comme les premires French
gouttes d'une pluie d'orage. Ma foi, dit Dants, voisin Caderousse, French
ce n'est point la peine de me dmentir pour si French
peu. Mercds n'est point encore ma femme, c'est vrai... il French
tira sa montre. Mais, dans une heure et demie elle French
le sera! Chacun poussa un cri de surprise,  l'exception French
du pre Dants, dont le large rire montra les dents French
encore belles. Mercds sourit et ne rougit plus. Fernand saisit French
convulsivement le manche de son couteau. Dans une heure! dit French
Danglars plissant lui-mme; et comment cela? Oui, mes amis, rpondit French
Dants, grce au crdit de M. Morrel, l'homme aprs mon French
pre auquel je dois le plus au monde, toutes les French
difficults sont aplanies. Nous avons achet les bans, et  French
deux heures et demie le maire de Marseille nous attend French
 l'htel de ville. Or, comme une heure et un French
quart viennent de sonner, je ne crois pas me tromper French
de beaucoup en disant que dans une heure trente minutes French
Mercds s'appellera Mme Dants. Fernand ferma les yeux: un nuage French
de feu brla ses paupires; il s'appuya  la table French
pour ne pas dfaillir, et, malgr tous ses efforts, ne French
put retenir un gmissement sourd qui se perdit dans le French
bruit des rires et des flicitations de l'assemble. C'est bien French
agir, cela, hein, dit le pre Dants. Cela s'appelle-t-il perdre French
son temps,  votre avis? Arriv d'hier au matin, mari French
aujourd'hui  trois heures! Parlez-moi des marins pour aller rondement French
en besogne. Mais les autres formalits, objecta timidement Danglars: le French
contrat, les critures?... Le contrat, dit Dants en riant, le French
contrat est tout fait: Mercds n'a rien, ni moi non French
plus! Nous nous marions sous le rgime de la communaut, French
et voil! a n'a pas t long  crire et French
ce ne sera pas cher  payer. Cette plaisanterie excita French
une nouvelle explosion de joie et de bravos. Ainsi, ce French
que nous prenions pour un repas de fianailles, dit Danglars, French
est tout bonnement un repas de noces. Non pas, dit French
Dants; vous n'y perdrez rien, soyez tranquilles. Demain matin, je French
pars pour Paris. Quatre jours pour aller, quatre jours pour French
revenir, un jour pour faire en conscience la commission dont French
je suis charg, et le 1er mars je suis de French
retour; au 2 mars donc le vritable repas de noces. French
Cette perspective d'un nouveau festin redoubla l'hilarit au point que French
le pre Dants, qui au commencement du dner se plaignait French
du silence, faisait maintenant, au milieu de la conversation gnrale, French
de vains efforts pour placer son voeu de prosprit en French
faveur des futurs poux. Dants devina la pense de son French
pre et y rpondit par un sourire plein d'amour. Mercds French
commena de regarder l'heure au coucou de la salle et French
fit un petit signe  Edmond. Il y avait autour French
de la table cette hilarit bruyante et cette libert individuelle French
qui accompagnent, chez les gens de condition infrieure, la fin French
des repas. Ceux qui taient mcontents de leur place s'taient French
levs de table et avaient t chercher d'autres voisins. Tout French
le monde commenait  parler  la fois, et personne French
ne s'occupait de rpondre  ce que son interlocuteur lui French
disait, mais seulement  ses propres penses. La pleur de French
Fernand tait presque passe sur les joues de Danglars; quant French
 Fernand lui-mme, il ne vivait plus et semblait un French
damn dans le lac de feu. Un des premiers, il French
s'tait lev et se promenait de long en large dans French
la salle, essayant d'isoler son oreille du bruit des chansons French
et du choc des verres. Caderousse s'approcha de lui au French
moment o Danglars, qu'il semblait fuir, venait de le rejoindre French
dans un angle de la salle. En vrit, dit Caderousse, French
 qui les bonnes faons de Dants et surtout le French
bon vin du pre Pamphile avaient enlev tous les restes French
de la haine dont le bonheur inattendu de Dants avait French
jet les germes dans son me, en vrit, Dants est French
un gentil garon; et quand je le vois assis prs French
de sa fiance, je me dis que 'et t dommage French
de lui faire la mauvaise plaisanterie que vous complotiez hier. French
Aussi, dit Danglars, tu as vu que la chose n'a French
pas eu de suite; ce pauvre M. Fernand tait si French
boulevers qu'il m'avait fait de la peine d'abord; mais du French
moment qu'il en a pris son parti, au point de French
s'tre fait le premier garon de noces de son rival, French
il n'y a plus rien  dire. Caderousse regarda Fernand, French
il tait livide. Le sacrifice est d'autant plus grand, continua French
Danglars, qu'en vrit la fille est belle. Peste! l'heureux coquin French
que mon futur capitaine; je voudrais m'appeler Dants douze heures French
seulement. Partons-nous? demanda la douce voix de Mercds; voici deux French
heures qui sonnent, et l'on nous attend  deux heures French
un quart. Oui, oui, partons! dit Dants en se levant French
vivement. Partons! rptrent en choeur tous les convives. Au mme French
instant, Danglars, qui ne perdait pas de vue Fernand assis French
sur le rebord de la fentre, le vit ouvrir des French
yeux hagards, se lever comme par un mouvement convulsif, et French
retomber assis sur l'appui de cette croise; presque au mme French
instant un bruit sourd retentit dans l'escalier; le retentissement d'un French
pas pesant, une rumeur confuse de voix mles  un French
cliquetis d'armes couvrirent les exclamations des convives, si bruyantes qu'elles French
fussent, et attirrent l'attention gnrale, qui se manifesta  l'instant French
mme par un silence inquiet. Le bruit s'approcha: trois coups French
retentirent dans le panneau de la porte; chacun regarda son French
voisin d'un air tonn. Au nom de la loi! cria French
une voix vibrante,  laquelle aucune voix ne rpondit. Aussitt French
la porte s'ouvrit, et un commissaire, ceint de son charpe, French
entra dans la salle, suivi de quatre soldats arms, conduits French
par un caporal. L'inquitude fit place  la terreur. Qu'y French
a-t-il? demanda l'armateur en s'avanant au-devant du commissaire qu'il connaissait; French
bien certainement, monsieur, il y a mprise. S'il y a French
mprise, monsieur Morrel, rpondit le commissaire croyez que la mprise French
sera promptement rpare; en attendant, je suis porteur d'un mandat French
d'arrt; et quoique ce soit avec regret que je remplisse French
ma mission, il ne faut pas moins que je la French
remplisse: lequel de vous, messieurs, est Edmond Dants? Tous les French
regards se tournrent vers le jeune homme qui, fort mu, French
mais conservant sa dignit, fit un pas en avant et French
dit: C'est moi, monsieur, que me voulez-vous? Edmond Dants, reprit French
le commissaire, au nom de la loi, je vous arrte! French
Vous m'arrtez! dit Edmond avec une lgre pleur, mais pourquoi French
m'arrtez-vous? Je l'ignore, monsieur, mais votre premier interrogatoire vous l'apprendra. French
M. Morrel comprit qu'il n'y avait rien  faire contre French
l'inflexibilit de la situation: un commissaire ceint de son charpe French
n'est plus un homme, c'est la statue de la loi, French
froide, sourde, muette. Le vieillard, au contraire, se prcipita vers French
l'officier; il y a des choses que le coeur d'un French
pre ou d'une mre ne comprendra jamais. Il pria et French
supplia: larmes et prires ne pouvaient rien; cependant son dsespoir French
tait si grand, que le commissaire en fut touch. Monsieur, French
dit-il, tranquillisez-vous; peut-tre votre fils a-t-il nglig quelque formalit de French
douane ou de sant, et, selon toute probabilit, lorsqu'on aura French
reu de lui les renseignements qu'on dsire en tirer, il French
sera remis en libert. Ah ! qu'est-ce que cela signifie? French
demanda en fronant le sourcil Caderousse  Danglars, qui jouait French
la surprise. Le sais-je, moi? dit Danglars; je suis comme French
toi: je vois ce qui se passe, je n'y comprends French
rien, et je reste confondu. Caderousse chercha des yeux Fernand: French
il avait disparu. Toute la scne de la veille se French
reprsenta alors  son esprit avec une effrayante lucidit. On French
et dit que la catastrophe venait de tirer le voile French
que l'ivresse de la veille avait jet entre lui et French
sa mmoire. Oh! oh! dit-il d'une voix rauque, serait-ce la French
suite de la plaisanterie dont vous parliez hier, Danglars? En French
ce cas, malheur  celui qui l'aurait faite, car elle French
est bien triste. Pas du tout! s'cria Danglars, tu sais French
bien, au contraire, que j'ai dchir le papier. Tu ne French
l'as pas dchir, dit Caderousse; tu l'as jet dans un French
coin, voil tout. Tais-toi, tu n'as rien vu, tu tais French
ivre. O est Fernand? demanda Caderousse. Le sais-je, moi! rpondit French
Danglars,  ses affaires probablement: mais, au lieu de nous French
occuper de cela, allons donc porter du secours  ces French
pauvres affligs. En effet, pendant cette conversation, Dants avait en French
souriant, serr la main  tous ses amis, et s'tait French
constitu prisonnier en disant: Soyez tranquilles, l'erreur va s'expliquer, et French
probablement que je n'irai mme pas jusqu' la prison. Oh! French
bien certainement, j'en rpondrais , dit Danglars qui, en ce French
moment, s'approchait, comme nous l'avons dit, du groupe principal. Dants French
descendit l'escalier, prcd du commissaire de police et entour par French
les soldats. Une voiture, dont la portire tait tout ouverte, French
attendait  la porte, il y monta, deux soldats et French
le commissaire montrent aprs lui; la portire se referma, et French
la voiture reprit le chemin de Marseille. Adieu, Dants! adieu, French
Edmond! s'cria Mercds en s'lanant sur la balustrade. Le prisonnier French
entendit ce dernier cri, sorti comme un sanglot du coeur French
dchir de sa fiance; il passa la tte par la French
portire, cria: Au revoir, Mercds! et disparut  l'un des French
angles du fort Saint-Nicolas. Attendez-moi ici, dit l'armateur, je prends French
la premire voiture que je rencontre, je cours  Marseille, French
et je vous rapporte des nouvelles. Allez! crirent toutes les French
voix, allez! et revenez bien vite! Il y eut, aprs French
ce double dpart, un moment de stupeur terrible parmi tous French
ceux qui taient rests. Le vieillard et Mercds restrent quelque French
temps isols, chacun dans sa propre douleur; mais enfin leurs French
yeux se rencontrrent; ils se reconnurent comme deux victimes frappes French

Davide Guglielmini, finito agli arresti domiciliari assieme ad altre quattro Italian
persone, hanno presentato alla Procura una documentazione composta da planimetrie Italian

bagni e dei priv sarebbe radicalmente cambiata   i Italian
anche la zona adibita a priv  stata modificata. Due Italian
elementi importanti, perch era appunto nei bagni e nel priv Italian
che i clienti, vip e persone comuni, consumavano cocaina, come Italian
documentato dalle cimici piazzate nel dalla polizia guarda il video. Italian
Le modifiche avrebbero eliminato le zone nascoste Avete partecipato in Italian
tanti alla bella discussione intorno agli aumenti della metro che Italian
scatteranno da domani solo per gli abbonamenti interurbani. Ognuno di Italian
voi ha detto la sua soprattutto su come funziona la Italian
metropolitana; bene, male, le linee sono adeguate, no non lo Italian
sono, si pu e si deve fare di pi Ha Italian
scritto chi da anni si documenta su queste infrastrutture per Italian
interessi personali e chi fin da adolescente ne  un Italian
tutti i giorni per lavoro. Otto mesi di ritardo ma Italian
si parte, ecco la novit. Il aprile sar inaugurata ! Italian
e potremo attraversare la parte settentrionale di Milano sottoterra secondo Italian
una nuova litania: San Siro/Harar, Esquilino, Segesta, Lotto M, Portello, Italian
Tretorri, Domodossola FNM, Gerusalemme, Cenisio, Monumentale e poi Garibaldi. Due Italian
talpe meccaniche si andranno incontro dai due estremi della linea, Italian
di volta in volta trovando le stazioni che nel frattempo Italian
dei privati, dello Stato e del Comune, riusciranno a rispettare Italian
della Sera che a partire da venerd settembre pubblicher dei Italian
accomunati dalla stessa propriet lo storico marchio Upim  sulla Italian
via del rilancio. Cos si  pensato di rendere pop Italian
le compere negli store della Upim. Come? Ce lo spiega Italian
chiave contemporanea: il mall come elemento dello spazio urbano e Italian
luogo di incontro, uno spazio accessibile, fresco, divertente in cui Italian
trovare le cose utili di ogni giorno, ma anche dove Italian
titolari si riesce a capire come la risposta non sia Italian
forno, nella bellissima cucina a vista. Ma anche gadget legati Italian
uova appesi al soffitto, o le torte glassate finte in Italian
vetrina, ad esempio, e la porta di legno celeste accanto Italian
al bancone. Il patto ha lo scopo di sanzionare i Italian
da decorare, a partire da quello simbolico di metri messo Italian
a disposizione di tra i migliori street artist italiani per Italian
della memoria come il Circo Massimo. La tre giorni organizzata Italian
dalla Grammi s.r.l. con il patrocinio del Comune di Roma, Italian
uno spazio sar espressamente dedicato ai bambini e alla cultura Italian
del murales nel rispetto della citt e della legalit. Quanto Italian
spesso sinonimo di una sosta veloce, magari in cassa non Italian
stato. Su un bene che, oltre tutto,  anche in Italian
ribasso le quotazione del caff arabica sono scese pesantemente in Italian
rincaro del %, ricavato da uno studio del Centro per Italian
i diritti del cittadino. Il CODICI ha monitorato il costo Italian
del caff in circa esercizi commerciali. E in su , Italian
circa , centesimi a tazzina. Non  poco, ovviamente, considerando Italian
anche che, secondo un calcolo approssimativo fatto sempre dal Centro Italian
per i diritti del cittadino, una singola tazzina pu arrivare Italian
guadagno di pi del %, se il caff viene fatto Italian
pagare come ormai spesso accade . centesimi. Dopo una lunga Italian
tra musica, moda, cinema e arte, seducendo un immaginario che Italian
gli anni con uno smagliante Boy George alle prese con Italian
anche cover e nuove hit come il brano ispirato a Italian
poteva mancare un padrino ideale da mettere in mostra: Il Italian
creatore della cultura del supermercato , Andy Warhol. Le inaugurazioni Italian
tele. La Chaingang Rotafixa S.p.A. vede nella ruota fissa non Italian
solo una bicicletta molto particolare, ma anche una metafora per Italian
un modello di condotta personale alternativo a quello attualmente dominante. Italian
Un modello che si basa sull'attribuire un elevato valore alla Italian
semplicit e alla ricerca dell'essenza delle cose. Che si pone Italian
criticamente e costantemente il problema di capire quando anzich aggiungere Italian
 forse meglio togliere. Che all'evanescente gratificazione istantanea preferisce la Italian
duratura gioia dell'applicarsi costantemente nel tempo per padroneggiare un'arte. Che Italian
crede nelle responsabilit del singolo nei confronti della collettivit, nella Italian
tutela di quel "bene comune" sia esso di natura sociale, Italian
architettonico o culturale che sembra oramai un concetto sconosciuto. La Italian
Chaingang  quindi anche un progetto di reinvenzione personale e Italian
sociale, un coraggioso tentativo di assumersi personalmente la responsabilit di Italian
costruire con fantasia un'orizzonte metropolitano e sociale pi vitale, creativo Italian
e stimolante di quello attuale. Partendo dalle cellule elementari del Italian
progetto umano le singole persone e dal loro polo di Italian
aggregazione fondamentale, la citt. La Chaingang Rotafixa S.p.A.  un Italian
gruppo di cannibali urbani dediti all'alta velocit e alla riconquista Italian
degli spazi urbani su bici a rapporto fisso. In una Italian
societ troppo spesso scardinata dal suo passato la nostra missione Italian
 quella di unire armonicamente una disciplina ciclistica storica quella Italian
appunto del fisso e della pista e la moderna metropoli, Italian
usando come collante quella velocit che  simbolo dei nostri Italian
tempi e ragione d'essere del pistard. Non  un'operazione nostalgica, Italian
ma piuttosto un riscoperta attiva e contemporanea di una meravigliosa Italian
arte da troppo tempo abbandonata nel dimenticatoio. Tra le molte Italian
ramificazioni dell'avventura di riscoperta della velocipede a rapporto fisso, Chaingang Italian
Rotafixa S.p.A. si  imbattuta quasi per caso nel suo Italian
essere un'efficace applicazione pratica della decrescita economica. Tale teoria  Italian
nata dalle intuizioni geniali quanto allora ignorate dell'economista rumeno Nicholas Italian
Georgescu Roegen, che nel suo The Entropy Law and the Italian
Economic Process dimostr l'impossibilt di una crescita economica indefinita. Con Italian
tale opera divenne inconsapevolmente il padre della bioeconomia, allora ignorata Italian
e oggi rafforzata dal contributo di pensatori come Serge Latouche, Italian
Ivan Illich e Alex Langer. Applicando le leggi fisiche della Italian
termodinamica ai meccanismi teorici dell'economia, Georgescu Roegen dimostr matematicamente la Italian
follia del perseguimento di una crescita economica basata sull'aumento costante Italian
della produzione e del consumo. Rest inascoltato dal gotha dell'economia, Italian
ed  solo recentemente che le sue teorie hanno incominciato Italian
a destare serio interesse da parte non solo di studiosi Italian
ma anche della societ civile. Un primo corollario della teoria Italian
di Georgescu Roegen prevede che non basta il rallentamento della Italian
crescita economica o addirittura il raggiungimento della "crescita zero", n Italian
tantomeno il perseguimento della crescita "sostenibile". Bisogna raggiungere una crescita Italian
negativa, cambiando tutto l'impianto non solo della struttura economica che Italian
l'Occidente ha cos ben incarnato ma l'intero stile di vita Italian
di ciascuno e quindi delle popolazioni. Obiettivo indubbiamente gigantesco, ma, Italian
secondo una minoranza di economisti e sociologi, a lungo termine Italian
anche inevitabile. La chiave di volta per riuscirci  la Italian
riscoperta di un mondo relazionale antico, quello della convivialit e Italian
quindi della semplicit: di scambi, di spostamenti, concetti, parole, relazioni, Italian
azioni. In due parole: vita semplice. Ma l'applicazione di questa Italian
sana e quasi ovvia formula trova formidabile resistenza nel fatto Italian
di essere percepito come un impoverimento e come una privazione, Italian
specialmente in una societ come quella Occidentale dove il benessere Italian
e l'agiatezza per ampi strati sociali sono conquiste storicamente recenti. Italian
Fare il salto da uno stato consolidato di benessere e Italian
comodit verso un nuovo ordine sociale basato sulla decrescita economica Italian
non e' cosa da poco, visto anche i pochi esempi Italian
atti a dimostrare concretamente che il salto non  un'azzardo Italian
ma porta invece a dei benefici riscontabili nella realt. E' Italian
proprio nel difficile passaggio di rendere tangibile il miglioramento offerto Italian
dalla decrescita economica che la bicicletta a ruota fissa pu Italian
dare un interessante contributo:  infatti un esempio concreto e Italian
lampante di come le decrescita economica anzich essere privazione e Italian
impoverimento  in realt l'esatto opposto. Vediamo il perch. Sotto Italian
un profilo puramente ciclistico le biciclette a ruota fissa sono Italian
mezzi incredibilmente precisi, scattanti, netti nelle risposte, immediatamente reattivi quando Italian
la concentrazione  totale. Mezzi leggeri come piume visto l'incredibile Italian
assenza di pezzi non ci sono i freni, cambi, deragiatori, Italian
leve, cavi. Rispetto alle tradizionali bici col cambio sono quindi Italian
molto pi divertenti ed emozionanti, e permettono al ciclista di Italian
concentrarsi sul puro piacere del pedalare. Il fisso inoltre affonda Italian
le sue radici nella cultura e nella tradizione della pista, Italian
una dimensione del ciclismo che trascende il gesto atletico per Italian
diventare arte pura: la conquista della pedalata sul fisso  Italian
anche la conquista della profonda gioia di imparare a danzare Italian
sul velocipede, la conquista dell'arte di andare in bicicletta. La Italian
riscopeta del fisso  anche un riprendere contatto con quel Italian
mondo della pista da molto tempo caduto nel dimenticatoio. E' Italian
una riscoperta delle nostre tradizioni e della nostra storia, basi Italian
sulle quali costruire un presente e futuro pi solidi di Italian
quelli attualmente possibili. E' la riscoperta di grandi campioni e Italian
artigiani del passato la cui integrit e genuina semplicit sono Italian
valori attualissimi da riscoprire e fare di nuovo nostri, per Italian
favorire un profondo rinovamento del tessuto umano della societ. Vi Italian
e' poi un circolo viruoso economico, personale e sociale messo Italian
in moto dalla bicicletta a rapporto fisso. Essendo un mezzo Italian
intrinsecamente leggero si possono utilizzare per la sua costruzione materiali Italian
come l'acciaio e componentistica lavorata in modo semplice: il risultato Italian
sono costi nettamente ridotti, minor spreco di risorse durante l'intero Italian
ciclo di produzione e maggiori affidabilit e longevit del mezzo. Italian
La sua semplicit e affidabilit diminuiscono drasticamente il dispendio di Italian
risorse necessarie per la manutenzione, migliorando molto la fruibilit del Italian
mezzo e la sua apetibilit per chi vuole un mezzo Italian
"no problem" per gli spostamenti personali. L'estrema leggerezza e semplicit Italian
rendono il mezzo a rapporto fisso facile e pratico da Italian
trasportare, aprendo cos le porte ad un modo di viaggiare Italian
con la bicicletta quesi sempre al seguito con i notevoli Italian
vantaggi che ne conseguono. I "fissati" sono poi una vera Italian
e propria trib il cui collante va ben oltre la Italian
semplice passione per la bicicletta, e questa permette anche una Italian
riscoperta di quella ricca convivialit sociale possibile solo con gruppi Italian
di persone eterogenee unite per da forti valori condivisi. Agli Italian
effetti finora esposti ne va aggiunto anche uno forse pi Italian
personale, ma facilmente riproducibile e gustoso: la possibilit di assemblare Italian
da s il mezzo che poi ci trasporter. Ancora oggi Italian
la bicicletta  il veicolo pi semplice da riparare e Italian
costruire, e la bici "decostruita" a maggior ragione, considerando la Italian
sua quasi incredibile mancanza di pezzi. Si potr quindi imparare, Italian
o reimparare chi non ha pasticciato sulla sua bici da Italian
bambino? gesti finalizzati e meccanicamente utili, quindi la riscoperta della Italian
propria manualit, capacit che abbiamo in comune tutti noi umani; Italian
ragionare con calma sui problemi meccanici che di volta in Italian
volta si presentano; assemblare la ruota a raggi, strumento quasi Italian
miracoloso per il suo essere incredibilmente robusto e graziosamente esile Italian
allo stesso tempo; trovare il miglior allineamento per la catena, Italian
il miglior scorrimento per il movimento centrale o la serie Italian
sterzo; e cos via. Riconnettendosi ancora una volta con il Italian
gusto del "fare", tanto sbandierato dagli imprenditori ma in realt Italian
comune a tutti tanto quanto le mani e il pollice Italian
opponibile. Se a questo si aggiunge la gioia di condividere Italian
le proprie soluzioni tecniche con altri, riscoprendo quindi la collaborativit Italian
disinteressata, otterremo un altro tassello verso la "convivialit felice" individuata Italian
come l'architrave del nuovo pensiero economico. Deve essere del tipo Italian
da passeggio larghezza /": quella da corsa larghezza /" di Italian
solito non va bene per via della sua larghezza ridotta. Italian
E' fondamentale avere un perfetto allineamento della catena tra pignone Italian
e corona altrimenti la catena gratta. Per ottenere la linea Italian
di catena giusta si pu giocare sulla lunghezza del perno Italian
del movimento centrale ce ne sono di misure diverse e Italian
sul montaggio interno/esterno della corona sulla pedivella. Per calcolare pi Italian
accuratamente la linea di catena del pignone e della corona Italian
che dovrebbero idealmente essere uguali consultare il sito di Sheldon Italian
Brown che riporta numerose misure a seconda del fabbricante di Italian
mozzi e guarniture. Da piazzale Maciachini imbocchi via Imbonati, passi Italian
sotto il ponte della ferrovia e continui dritto su via Italian
Pellegrino Rossi. La seconda via che incontri sulla destra si Italian
chiama via Semplicit. Il nome  curioso. Ti viene da Italian
chiederti chiss chi  stato che un bel giorno, seduto Italian
in un ufficio del comune di Milano, ha pensato che Italian
era il caso di dedicare una via alla semplicit. Una Italian
volta per dedicare una via a qualcuno doveva essere morto Italian
da un pezzo. Forse qualcuno ha deciso che la semplicit Italian
 ormai definitivamente morta e sepolta, e tanto vale dedicarle Italian
una via. Se la imbocchi a un certo punto, sulla Italian
destra, ti trovi davanti a una serranda verde. I vetri Italian
sono di quelli che non fanno vedere all'interno. E poi Italian
in ogni caso sulla serranda ci sono adesivi dappertutto. Non Italian
c' una vera e propria insegna. Per con delle lettere Italian
adesive bianche ci hanno scritto "fabbrica di biciclette". La porta Italian
 chiusa a chiave e c' un campanello, ma basta Italian
provare a girare la maniglia che subito ti apre un Italian
signore sulla sessantina dall'aspetto modesto, pochi capelli e un paio Italian
di occhiali con la montatura nera. Sul muro un poster Italian
di Gianni Bugno in maglia iridata, in piedi sui pedali. Italian
A sinistra c' una stanza che fa da esposizione, dove Italian
ha sistemato alcune biciclette da corsa. Sono vecchie e si Italian
vede lontano un miglio: telai in acciaio con le congiunzioni, Italian
e poi quei colori improbabili, giallo oro, amaranto, bianco sporco, Italian
carta da zucchero... Dietro invece c' l'officina. Scaffali di metallo Italian
lungo le pareti e due grossi tavoli nel mezzo della Italian
stanza. Sui tavoli non potresti appoggiare nemmeno un bullone, tale Italian
 il groviglio di chiavi inglesi, a brugola, guarniture, pignoni, Italian
pedivelle, raggi, pezzi e attrezzi vari che li ricopre. Appesi Italian
al soffitto vecchi telai, ancora negli stessi colori fuori moda. Italian
Per terra, appoggiati agli scaffali, decine di cerchi e coperture. Italian
L'impressione  di disordine totale e ne sei un po' Italian
disorientato. Poi ti abitui, inizi ad osservare meglio, e ti Italian
accorgi che alcuni dei telai lass hanno i forcellini con Italian
l'innesto posteriore, e che i vecchi manubri da corsa che Italian
si intrecciano sull'ultimo ripiano dello scaffale di sinistra hanno una Italian
curvatura insolita... Tornando nell'ingresso ti accorgi anche che appeso al Italian
muro non c' solo Bugno ma una grande foto in Italian
bianco e nero con due pistard sulla linea del traguardo. Italian
Gli attacchi manubrio che guardano in gi, i pedali con Italian
le cinghiette, tutto evoca i tempi lontani e le atmosfere Italian
perdute degli anni d'oro della pista. La bici trasformata in Italian
attrezzo ginnico, la velocit pura, spettacolo di forza, tecnica e Italian
astuzia...I due corridori hanno tutti e due la stessa maglia, Italian
che probabilmente era azzurra. Riconosci infatti lo scudetto tricolore sul Italian
petto. Quello di sinistra  fermato nell'attimo in cui si Italian
sta rialzando per esultare. Lo guardi, poi guardi il signore Italian
con gli occhiali che ti ha aperto la porta e Italian
che adesso sta parlando al telefono, poi ti giri e Italian
solo allora vedi sopra la porta due vecchi diplomi diligentemente Italian
messi in cornice, e cominci a capire. Chi ti sta Italian
davanti  Giovanni Pettenella, detto Vanni, ex pollivendolo di Caprino Italian
Veronese trapiantato a Milano, uno che alle Olimpiadi di Tokio Italian
nel ha vinto la medaglia d'oro nella velocit su pista Italian
davanti a un'altro italiano, Sergio Bianchetto, e quella d'argento nel Italian
chilometro da fermo, battuto di mezzo secondo dal belga Patrick Italian
Sercu, che doveva poi diventare il re delle Sei Giorni. Italian
Uno che nella semifinale di quelle stesse Olimpiadi, contro il Italian
francese Pierre Trentin, prima di infilarlo come un pollo sullo Italian
spiedo si  concesso ben minuti di surplace. Uno che Italian
nell'agosto del , ai campionati italiani della pista, velodromo di Italian
Varese, pista scoperta in cemento, del surplace ha stabilito il Italian
record del mondo, tuttora imbattuto, con ora e minuti. La Italian
Rai ha fatto tre collegamenti in diretta e niente, loro Italian
sempre l, immobili, con Martellini che non sapeva pi chi Italian
intervistare e una folla di curiosi che accorreva al velodromo. Italian
Il suo avversario era ancora Bianchetto, lo stesso delle Olimpiadi, Italian
che dopo un'ora e minuti fermo sotto il sole di Italian
agosto, con le mani strette sul manubrio e i piedi Italian
serrati dalle cinghiette tirate a tutta, si  accasciato sul Italian
cemento. E' andato proprio gi come un fico, svenuto. Nel Italian
cassetto, custodita dentro una busta beige, ha ancora la telefoto. Italian
E lui invece sempre l, fermo, ad aspettare l'intervento del Italian
medico e che gli convalidassero la vittoria nella prima volata. Italian
Uno che partiva ad ottobre e andava in Australia, a Italian
correre le Sei Giorni, e tornava a Marzo, in tempo Italian
magari per iscriversi alla Sanremo da isolato. Il tutto per Italian
guadagnare la met di uno stradista. Ma erano altri tempi, Italian
tempi poveri in cui il francese Trentin quando era andato Italian
alle olimpiadi non aveva ancora il bagno in casa, e Italian
lo stesso Pettenella aveva subito venduto a Tokio la Masi Italian
con cui aveva vinto la medaglia d'oro. Ha corso per Italian
vent'anni, e quando ha smesso, nel ',  stato Direttore Italian
Tecnico del Vigorelli sino alla chiusura, nel . Intanto ha Italian
fatto il commissario tecnico della nazionale italiana pista, sia dei Italian
dilettanti che dei professionisti. Dopo la chiusura del Vigorelli ha Italian
fatto ancora qualche anno al velodromo di Busto Garolfo. Intanto Italian
si era anche messo a fare le biciclette, e quelle Italian
da pista portano tutte la scritta Vigorelli sul tubo piantone. Italian
Il terzo di Tokio ', il francese Morelon, dirige ancora Italian
la pista in Francia. Lui, che  stato l'ultima medaglia Italian
italiana della velocit, invece se ne sta fra i suoi Italian
telai e i suoi ricordi in un angolo di periferia Italian
milanese, dove ogni tanto qualcuno lo chiama se gli serve Italian
un consiglio, o lo va a trovare se gli serve Italian
un pezzo. A comprargli la roba arrivano anche dal Giappone, Italian
e noi non sapevamo nemmeno che esistesse... La pista  Italian
stata la sua vita. Starebbe per ore a raccontarti come Italian
si fissano i tubolari con la ceralacca o come si Italian
frena appoggiando la mano guantata sul tubolare e tu staresti Italian
per ore ad ascoltarlo a bocca aperta come un bambino Italian
che ascolta le favole. Fino a ieri le sue storie Italian
e la sua esperienza non interessavano pi a nessuno, e Italian
forse ogni ciclista che ami le due ruote almeno un Italian
p dovrebbe arrossire di vergogna di fronte a quest'inspiegabile indifferenza. Italian
O forse sarebbe semplicemente il caso di inforcare la bicicletta Italian
e dirigersi verso quella serranda verde ed il mondo di Italian
rara bellezza che custodisce, affinch il tesoro non vada perduto Italian
per sempre. Tutto inizia molto tempo fa. Pi o meno Italian
all'inizio del ciclismo, prima che qualcuno un italiano, come sempre Italian
inventasse la ruota libera. Prima di allora si andava in Italian
bici con un pignone avvitato sul mozzo. Non c'era altro Italian
da fare. Non esisteva la "ruota fissa": era la bici Italian
e basta. Poi tutto cambi, e fu un bene per Italian
la bicicletta: la ruota fissa fu presto un ricordo, stranamente Italian
tenuto in vita solo in Giamaica uno dei tanti fatti Italian
strani di questo pianeta. Si arriva ad oggi, in Italia, Italian
il novembre . Tempo prima un gruppo di persone, stanche Italian
delle asfissianti norme che imbrigliavano le corse in bicicletta ed Italian
esasperati dall'incapacit della societ italiana contemporanea di reinventare gli spazi Italian
metropolitani, avevano portato qui un'esperienza nata altrove, le gare di Italian
velocit non comunicate ad alcuna autorit ed effettuate con velocipedi Italian
di forma qualunque all'interno delle citt. In quell'altrove le chiamano Italian
"alley cats races", qui le chiamano "velocity", un bellissimo gioco Italian
di parole tra velocit in inglese, vlo bici in francese Italian
e city citt sempre in inglese: velocit in bici in Italian
citt. Le velocity si effettuano da un paio d'anni. Prima Italian
a Milano, poi anche a Roma. Quella del novembre , Italian
la terza di Roma, vede per la prima volta da Italian
molto tempo oltre anni la partecipazione di bici a ruota Italian
fissa, cos tanto scomparse dalla memoria che sembrano ormai una Italian
novit. Io sono uno di questi. Uno di quelli che Italian
vengono visti come marziani o, peggio, come uno che "lo Italian
fa strano". Ho solo una bici a ruota fissa, non Italian
le antenne o le branchie. Non sono solo. Insieme a Italian
me ci sono altre persone che ormai non possono fare Italian
a meno di questo modo incredibilmente efficiente e semplice di Italian
andare in bici. Ancora siamo pochi su partecipanti a questa Italian
stramba e veloce gara in ambito urbano, gara mai e Italian
poi mai comunicata ad alcuno se non a quelli che, Italian
per vie elettroniche, sanno di questa esplosione improvvisa di atomi Italian
lungo le vie di una citt. Il tempo  grigio. Italian
E' l'alba. E' domenica. Le condizioni migliori per prendere una Italian
citt e farla nostra. Ogni partenza di velocity che ho Italian
visto finora  diversa. Questa  assurda. Prima si aspetta Italian
di sapere che fine ha fatto una ragazza che venendo Italian
l si  fatta male scivolando sui binari bagnati dalla Italian
pioggia della notte. Quando sappiamo che  al sicuro dentro Italian
un'ambulanza che la porter ai suoi quattro punti di sutura, Italian
pensiamo alla partenza. Si parte come frecce. Qualcuno cade sui Italian
binari di via Marmorata, ne sento il rumore di ferraglia Italian
strisciante. C' una fratellanza spontanea tra rotafixari: in quattro ci Italian
fiondiamo sul lungotevere ad almeno cento pedalate al minuto, cercando Italian
contemporaneamente di staccare eventuali incauti inseguitori e di calmare la Italian
furia che covava da almeno il giorno prima. Si pedala. Italian
Forte. L'unica cosa che ricordo  il silenzio meccanico dei Italian
mezzi, sibilanti solo per il contatto delle ruote con l'asfalto Italian
gi pieno d'acqua. Qualche frase tra noi, per accordare meglio Italian
la pedalata. Qualche gutturale segnale d'attenzione agli incroci, stupidamente addobbati Italian
di luci a volte rosse. Il silenzio. Il sibilo delle Italian
ruote. Le mani che si aggrappano al manubrio. Non ho Italian
due gambe, ho solo il mezzo per trasmettere velocit alla Italian
bici. Credo di non avere niente di civile o cortese Italian
addosso. Quando facevo in moto quel percorso mi sembrava una Italian
cosa lunga. Adesso mi sembra che non siano passati due Italian
minuti e arriviamo alla fine provvisoria del lungotevere. Bisogna girare Italian
e andare sulla Flaminia. Lo facciamo, stavolta in tre, si Italian
salta un marciapiede, si accelera su una strada che all'improvviso Italian
diventa contromano e insieme corsia del tram. La pioggia ora Italian
batte. Rimbalza sull'asfalto. Pedaliamo. Un tram davanti. Scendiamo dalle bici Italian
dopo aver solo rallentato, ci leviamo dalla vita il tram Italian
che aveva ralllentato anche lui vedendo questo gruppo assurdo, rimontiamo Italian
e ripartiamo sotto il diluvio che continua a cercare di Italian
darci noia, non sapendo che non lo guardiamo neanche. Uno Italian
di noi comincia a mugolare o ululare di gioia. Lo Italian
capisco. Preferisco risparmiare fiato ma vorrei urlare anch'io. Lampi: noi, Italian
non il temporale. Vedo per caso uno dei partecipanti riparato Italian
sotto una tettoia. Forse ha detto: "ma che continuate?". Ecco Italian
lo stadio. Terrore: c' qualcuno davanti. Orrore: sono di quelli Italian
che vannno meno forte. Abbiamo sbagliato strada. Cazzo. Li supero Italian
a rotta di collo, sta iniziando la salita. Non so Italian
cosa sia successo, poi. Perdo i miei compagni di treno Italian
eravamo un vero treno: a ruota, dandoci il cambio, si Italian
andava forte. Strepito sulla salitina dell'Olimpico. Vado forte ma a Italian
mio svantaggio: mi sembra di morire. Scendo gi per una Italian
scorciatoia e guadagno molto di quanto perso. Per sono solo, Italian
mi piace di meno, mi piaceva di pi quando con Italian
quattro fisse eravamo sibilanti sull'asfalto. Capisco chi va in pista Italian
a tirare come un dannato nella scia degli altri o Italian
facendo scia, con il solo rumore dell'aria e delle gomme Italian
rotolanti. Mi trovo da solo a sputare sangue verso i Italian
Parioli. Solo fino a qualche chilometro dopo, quando incrocio uno Italian
di noi che ha bucato, e procede lento per arrivare Italian
comunque alla fine: un gigante dell'agonismo, si sarebbe trascinato sui Italian
gomiti. Continuo, capisco di aver perso molta strada e accelero. Italian
Mi bruciano le gambe, sputo ogni tanto, inizio ad essere Italian
irritato con tutte le macchine che incontro mentre io sono Italian
contromano. Arrivo sull'Appia Antica da un sentiero che speravo essere Italian
aperto ed in effetti lo era. Trovo due dei favoriti Italian
lungo la strada. Penso quindi di essere tra i primi, Italian
almeno questo...No, hanno fatto delle scelte errate anche loro. Dopo Italian
averli inseguiti per i restanti tre chilometri, a distanza invariata, Italian
mi ritrovo a sputare l'ultimo pezzo di polmone verso l'arrivo Italian
guardando una piccola folla gi ferma. Qualcosa non ha funzionato Italian
nel mio percorso. L'oggettivit del metodo scientifico sembra essere stata Italian
dirottata dalle corporazioni che spesso pagano gli scienziati e i Italian
ricercatori per supportare i loro prodotti, cos come i politici Italian
che si muovono attraverso la porta girevole tra il settore Italian
pubblico e privato. Ancor peggio quando alcune agenzie per la Italian
protezione del consumatore sono complici. La fiducia dei consumatori negli Italian
studi scientifici e nella supervisione federale  stata violata a Italian
favore del profitto in maniera che i prodotti vengano introdotti Italian
sul mercato con uno standard di sicurezza molto ridotto. Le Italian
sostanze chimiche di sintesi che troviamo quotidianamente nei nostri alimenti, Italian
nell'acqua e nel nostro ambiente circostante stanno aumentando dimostrandosi disastrose Italian
alla nostra salute mentale e fisica. Potrebbero essere scritti interi Italian
volumi quindi sono stati scritti sia dagli esperti della medicina Italian
ufficiale che alternativa che documentano i giochi di prestigio che Italian
hanno raggirato i consumatori e compromesso la nostra salute. Le Italian
categorie sottostanti sono da considerare come una approfondita investigazione che Italian
vale come esempio per cosa dobbiamo affrontare come specie continuamente Italian
bombardata da queste sostanze chimiche. Anche se questo sembra bizzarro Italian
le leggi che limitano i privati nel raccogliere l'acqua nelle Italian
loro case e terre sono state oggetto di discussione per Italian
molto tempo negli stati occidentali. Ma solo recentemente, a causa Italian
degli aumenti di siccit e interessi nei metodi di conservazione Italian
dell'acqua, le persone hanno incominciato a sbattere le proprie teste Italian
contro l'inasprimento delle leggi che riguardano la pratica della raccolta Italian
dell'acqua piovana per utilizzo personale. Dopo aver costruito nella sua Italian
concessione un grande sistema per il collezionamento dell'acqua da utilizzare Italian
per lavare le macchine, Miller scopr che il suo progetto Italian
era "un'illegale raccolta di acqua piovana". Anche se collezionare acqua Italian
piovana ha un logico senso di conservazione, visto che nello Italian
Utah la pioggia  scarsa, questa viene considerata una violazione Italian
dei diritti sull'acqua che apparentemente sono esclusivi di enti governativi Italian
dello Utah. Negli Stati Uniti la tecnica  stata ampiamente Italian
che permettesse la copertura assicurativa ospedaliera incredibile!. Oggi  ancora Italian
utilizzata. E si dice anche che viene utilizzata in forme Italian
non abbiano ottenuto le risposte desiderate. Insomma: si fa passare Italian
corrente elettrica nel cervello, sperando che cambi qualcosa. Si provocano Italian
la protagonista, presunta affetta da schizofrenia che poi si  Italian
dimostrato non essere vero ha detto che, nel suo ricovero Italian
in clinica, aveva subito oltre elettroshock. Le sue parole furono Italian
Inghilterra e in USA chiama i consumatori di integratori a Italian
partecipare alla sua campagna di contestazione della burocrazia europea. I Italian
funzionari della Commissione si accingono a dare il via a Italian
nuove regole sui prodotti naturali, secondo le leggi europee che Italian
prevedono un regolamento ma non ne specificano i dettagli. Saranno Italian
infatti i burocrati a dirci quali nutrienti e a che Italian
dosaggi saranno disponibili in un futuro mercato unificato. Era una Italian
colazione di lavoro organizzata dalla eurodeputata irlandese Marian Harkin, la Italian
burocrati pi vicini alla spinosa questione di come esattamente limitare Italian
non siete gli unici. Circa un terzo degli Italiani infatti Italian
per gli alimenti EFSA che le restrizioni previste su nutrienti Italian
vitaminici e altri prodotti naturali avranno effetti deleteri sulla libert Italian
di scelta dei consumatori e la professione di naturopati ed Italian
un duro colpo alla prevenzione delle malattie attraverso la nutrizione. Italian
Quando parliamo di scie chimiche si intende porre l'attenzione sullo Italian
strano fenomeno delle emissioni rilasciate da non ben identificati aerei Italian
sulle nostre teste, sulle nostre citt e campagne che non Italian
sono e non devono essere associate al normale traffico aereo Italian
o a quelle che vengono chiamate "scie di condensa" provocate Italian
dal passaggio degli aereomobili in particolari condizioni atmosferiche e ancor Italian
meno a quelle emissioni che sono "mentalmente associabili" ad un Italian
motore che brucia carburante. Sembra che non abbiamo imparato nulla Italian
da ci che  successo tra il e il . Italian
Le autorit sanitarie di tutto il mondo sono ancora una Italian
volta cadute nella trappola tesa da chi voleva guadagnare miliardi Italian
sulla nostra pelle. Il business cominci con la vendita di Italian
un farmaco largamente inefficace, il famigerato Tamiflu oseltamivir, del quale Italian
i governi, quello italiano incluso, comprarono milioni di dosi. Le Italian
vendite dei farmaci antivirali per influenza sono quintuplicate rispetto all'anno Italian
precedente: hanno raggiunto un totale di , miliardi di dollari, Italian
, miliardi dei quali per il Tamiflu svizzero Roche. Poi Italian
fu la volta del vaccino, preparato in fretta e furia Italian
e venduto ai governi come unico mezzo per evitare la Italian
catastrofe. Non era possibile sperimentarlo per accertarne n l'efficacia n Italian
l'innocuit, ma questo  un piccolo dettaglio del quale non Italian
si parla nelle comunicazioni ufficiali. Tanto, era stato proclamato il Italian
massimo livello di allerta e poi ... i vaccini erano Italian
raccomandati dall'OMS, l'Organizzazione Mondiale della Salute. Le vendite di vaccini Italian
dovute alla "pandemia" HN sono state stimate in circa miliardi Italian
di dollari. C'era solo un problema. La pandemia non ci Italian
fu e il pubblico non si fid delle raccomandazioni a Italian
vaccinarsi tutti. Cos, centinaia di milioni di dosi del vaccino Italian
HN non sono stati usati e giacciono tuttora nelle celle Italian
frigorifere della Croce Rossa, aspettando la nuova stagione influenzale quest'autunno, Italian
oppure la richiesta di un paese che ne abbia bisogno Italian
chiss per quale ragione. Questo per fa poca differenza per Italian
le case farmaceutiche. Ormai loro hanno venduto e incassato. ROMA Italian

da Raffaele Guariniello. E che oltre alla corruzione ipotizza un Italian
sistema che potrebbe avare arrecato danni alla salute dei cittadini. Italian
Un esempio: il caso Aulin. Nimesulide  la molecola, Aulin Italian
 il farmaco pi noto tra i molti in commercio Italian
che contengono questo principio attivo. Un anti infiammatorio Fans che Italian
pu anche avere gravi effetti collaterali sul fegato. Mai approvato Italian
negli Stati Uniti e in Giappone. Ritirato nel in Spagna Italian
e Finlandia. E nel maggio in Irlanda dopo che sei Italian
pazienti subirono un trapianto di fegato per sopravvivere alle lesioni Italian
causate dall'abuso del farmaco. L'Italia nicchia, a chi ne chiede Italian
il ritiro viene risposto che i benefici in un certo Italian
sono superiori ai rischi. Basta rispettare l'obbligo di prescrizione da Italian
parte del medico. Di verifiche e studi per appurarne la Italian
reale pericolosit non se ne parla. Solo monitoraggio. Perch? La Italian
risposta in un filmato di due minuti. Un mediatore passa Italian
una mazzetta a Pasqualino Rossi per lasciare tranquillo l'Aulin. Un Italian
regista con le stellette ha immortalato immagini e suoni del Italian
pagamento in contanti, la gioia del numero due dell'Aifa rappresentante Italian

in banca per coprire il conto in rosso. Un corto Italian

indagati ma forse saranno di pi dopo gli interrogatori di Italian
oggi in carcere a Roma, da parte della procura di Italian
Torino dopo due anni di inchiesta sull'Aifa partita gennaio  Italian
da alcuni dossier per l'approvazione di alcuni farmaci bioequivalenti o Italian
generici. I provvedimenti, firmati dal gip torinese, riguardano Pasqualino Rossi Italian
carcere e Antonella Bove arresti domiciliari, dirigenti Aifa. Altre ordinanze Italian
tre in carcere, tre in casa riguardano procuratori delle aziende: Italian
Matteo Mantovani, Sante Di Renzo, Mario Umbri, Piera Campanella e Italian
Francesca Fiorenza. Un sesto manager  ancora ricercato: sarebbe all'estero. Italian
Tutto registrato, immagini e suoni. Prove contenute nelle pagine della Italian
richiesta di arresti, che poi il Gip ha sintetizzato in Italian
soli otto arresti e pagine di ordinanza. Anche Nello Martini, Italian
che smentisce di essere indagato,  protagonista di intercettazioni chiave: Italian

di un funzionario Aifa assunta da una delle aziende di Italian

ministro Maurizio Sacconi ha deciso l'avvio di una commissione d'indagine Italian
composta da tre autorevoli esperti : dovr fornire le prime Italian
valutazioni tra sette giorni, poi un pi completo rapporto entro Italian
il luglio . All'esame un sistema molto raffinatosi dopo lo Italian
scandalo che anni fa ha coinvolto Duilio Poggiolini e la Italian
Cuf, l'equivalente dell'Aifa di allora. Il filone sul sangue infetto Italian
Hiv ed epatiti B e C  ancora aperto. A Italian
Napoli dovranno decidere su Poggiolini, estraneo a tutto il ministro Italian
della Sanit dell'epoca Giovanni De Lorenzo. L'Aifa fu istituita ex Italian

 Mi vorrei ricollegare alle lettere pubblicate negli scorsi giorni Italian
sentivo il bisogno di esprimere una mia opinione su questo Italian
argomento, portando la voce di chi, come me, si sente Italian
poco rappresentato. Sono cristiana cattolica, ho fatto un cammino di Italian
catechista, animatrice, corista. Sono cresciuta in una famiglia molto cattolica Italian
e praticante, ma ho sempre cercato di leggere in modo Italian
personale le indicazioni della Chiesa. Faccio molta fatica a capire Italian
quello che sento dire riguardo i DICO e le coppie Italian
di fatto, faccio fatica a condividere i toni usati dai Italian
la Chiesa non sono solo i vescovi e il Papa, Italian
la Chiesa siamo tutti noi. E proprio per questo, come Italian
componente della Chiesa a cui mi sento ancora di appartenere, Italian
voglio condividere i miei pensieri con le persone che con Italian
dolore ascoltano la posizione intransigente e lontana delle istituzioni ecclesiastiche. Italian
Non vivo il problema in prima persona, ma  come Italian
se lo sentissi sulla mia pelle. Ho la fortuna di Italian
avere un mio carissimo amico omosessuale e di aver capito, Italian
grazie a lui e al suo percorso di sofferenza prima Italian
e di liberazione poi, come sia difficile essere se stessi Italian
e farsi accettare per una cosa che non ci si Italian
sceglie. Ho vissuto attraverso lui il dolore di sentirsi rifiutato Italian
dalla Chiesa che amava e di cui si sentiva parte Italian
col terrore di perderli per sempre. Grazie a lui ho Italian
conosciuto tante altre persone che hanno fatto, in modi diversi, Italian
lo stesso cammino. Vedo ogni giorno la difficolt di doversi Italian
frenare nel manifestare in pubblico i propri sentimenti, di dover Italian
nascondere sul lavoro e nelle attivit quotidiane il proprio stato, Italian
come se fosse una vergogna. Sono persone come le altre, Italian
si alzano ogni mattina per andare a lavorare, cucinano, fanno Italian
la spesa, stirano, pagano le tasse e le bollette. E Italian
hanno sentimenti. E quindi mi chiedo: perch condannare queste persone Italian
alla solitudine? Perch non dar modo a loro, come a Italian
tutti, di vivere delle relazioni affettive con tutti i diritti Italian
e i doveri che ne conseguono? La Chiesa dice che Italian
non condanna, ma chiede la castit. Ma che senso ha Italian
nessuno di loro abbia scelto di essere omosessuale. Perch si Italian
vede ancora tale condizione come una malattia, una devianza, una Italian
trasgressione, quando gli studi scientifici hanno dimostrato che non  Italian
cos? Per quale ragione un sentimento non pu dimostrarsi attraverso Italian
il corpo che Dio ci ha dato proprio per questo? Italian
Io sono profondamente in crisi e mi sento delusa e Italian
nessuna minaccia alla famiglia dai DICO. Piuttosto capisce che ci Italian
sono altre cose che mettono in crisi la famiglia: la Italian
per tutta la vita. Forse sono queste le cose che Italian
la Chiesa dovrebbe combattere e contro cui dovrebbe spingere i Italian
politici cattolici a mobilitarsi. Se due persone si amano non Italian
fanno male a nessuno, anzi, sono un esempio da imitare, Italian
come Ges ci ha insegnato. In questi giorni della Santa Italian
Pasqua sarebbe bello che ci fossero pi parole di speranza, Italian
di gioia, di fiducia. Buona Pasqua! Chiedo scusa a quelli Italian
che si sono sentiti toccati, come Romanaaa, ma non volevo Italian
fare di tutta un'erba un fascio. Ho solo detto due Italian
episodi di vita scolastica, ma potrei raccontarne tanti altri. Il Italian
problema  proprio questo passaggio di accuse reciproche tra scuola Italian
e famiglia. Ma il bambino che arriva a scuola viene Italian
da anni con la sua famiglia e anni di scuola Italian
materna. Ormai ha gi delle abitudini consolidate che noi, alle Italian
elementari, non sappiamo pi togliere. Se le mosche bianche, ormai, Italian
come Romanaaa e altri genitori che conosco e che per Italian
fortuna esistono ancora, vogliono dare un'educazione civile e rispettosa ai Italian
figli, devono fare i conti con la maggioranza, che sono Italian
i lavativi, sia tra i genitori che tra gli insegnanti. Italian
Se un bambino arriva a tagliare i capelli durante la Italian
lezione, non credo che sia colpa dell'insegnante, ma di chi Italian
gli ha negato delle regole di comportamento. L'insegnante non pu Italian
oggettivamente controllare a vista ogni bambino e bloccare ogni gesto, Italian
deve anche scrivere alla lavagna, correggere, distribuire libri e quaderni, Italian
fare lezione e spiegare. Il taglio dei capelli avviene in Italian
pochi secondi. Il problema  come  stata poi affrontata Italian
la vicenda. L'insegnante ne ha parlato con tutti i bambini? Italian
Ha chiamato i genitori di Edward Mani di forbice? Ha Italian
dato una sanzione? Altro episodio: un mio alunno l'anno scorso Italian
facendo le "scivolate" in salone che noi abbiamo sempre vietato Italian
ha fatto sbattere una compagna contro il muro e si Italian
 rotta il braccio. Eravamo presenti in insegnanti. Abbiamo rimproverato Italian
il "colpevole", dopo ovviamente aver soccorso la bimba, che urlava Italian
dal dolore. Abbiamo comunicato il fatto ai genitori del bambino, Italian
che sono subito venuti ad accusarci di non sorvegliare abbastanza Italian
i bambini e di non aver voluto ascoltare le ragioni Italian
del figlio, dopo l'episodio, che si sarebbe giustificato dicendo che Italian
lo avevano spinto. In realt non era vero, ma la Italian
famiglia ha subito preso le difese del bambino. Poi usciti Italian
dalla scuola ho visto lo stesso bambino che si appendeva Italian
a testa in giu ad una cancellata, mentre i genitori Italian
parlavano con altri, probabilmente dicendone di ogni sulle maestre, senza Italian
che gli dicessero niente, senza neanche guardarlo. postato da ariet Italian

venuta a trovarmi Daniela, un'amica di vecchia data, con cui Italian
ho condiviso un corso per insegnare inglese, due vacanze studio, Italian
molti interessi e una grande passione per il nostro lavoro. Italian
E' insegnante come me e per questo forse mi sento Italian
capita di pi. Dopo i classici sfoghi reciproci sul tema Italian
"Scuola, colleghi e paranoie" siamo passati a discorsi pi profondi, Italian
senza accorgercene, come solo con lei riesco a fare. Il Italian
senso della vita, del denaro, delle parole, della fede, della Italian
politica... cos, davanti a una tazza di caff solubile deca Italian
io, d'orzo lei e diverse sigarette. Dopo che se ne Italian
 andata stavo gi meglio. E' una persona che vedo Italian
pochissimo, sento poco, ma  come se fosse sempre con Italian
me. Abbiamo una bella sintonia e la nostra amicizia  Italian
quella che io considero "l'amicizia con la A maiuscola" perch Italian
non  vincolante, ognuna ha la sua vita, le sue Italian
cose, i suoi amici, il suo lavoro, ma quando ci Italian
si vede  come se ci si vedesse ogni giorno. Italian
Tanti scrivono libri, e molti bloggers mettono su carta quello Italian
che mettono in rete. Mi piacerebbe che certe riflessioni di Italian
vita comune venissero unite in un libro, magari a , Italian
, ,... n mani! Lancio l'idea agli amici dell'Osteria... Un Italian
bambino di seconda  uscito dall'aula con la merendina in Italian
mano e se la sbatteva furiosamente sui genitali. Poi ci Italian
si chiede dove sono gli insegnanti quando succedono certe cose. Italian
Io avere il cuore pi bello del mondo, o quantomeno Italian
della vallata. Tutti quanti gliel'ammiravano: era davvero perfetto, senza il Italian
minimo difetto. Erano tutti concordi nell'ammettere che quello era proprio Italian
il cuore pi bello che avessero mai visto in vita Italian
loro, e pi lo dicevano, pi il giovane s'insuperbiva e Italian
si vantava di quel suo cuore meraviglioso. All'improvviso spunt fuori Italian
dal nulla un vecchio, che emergendo dalla folla disse: "Beh, Italian
a dire il vero.. il tuo cuore  molto meno Italian
bello del mio." Quando lo mostr, aveva puntati addosso gli Italian
occhi di tutti: della folla, e del ragazzo. C'erano zone Italian
dalle quali erano stati asportati dei pezzi e rimpiazzati con Italian
altri, ma non combaciavano,cos il cuore risultava tutto bitorzoluto. Per Italian
giunta, era pieno di grossi buchi dove mancavano interi pezzi. Italian
Il giovane guard com'era ridotto quel vecchio e scoppi a Italian
ridere: "Starai scherzando!",disse. "Confronta il tuo cuore col mio: il Italian
mio  perfetto, mentre il tuo  un rattoppo di Italian
ferite e lacrime.". Vero.", ammise il vecchio. "Il tuo ha Italian
un aspetto assolutamente perfetto, ma non farei mai cambio col Italian
mio. Vedi, ciascuna ferita rappresenta una persona alla quale ho Italian
donato il mio affetto: ho staccato un pezzo del mio Italian
cuore e gliel'ho dato, e spesso ne ho ricevuto in Italian
cambio un pezzo del loro cuore, a colmare il vuoto Italian
lasciato nel mio cuore. Ma, certo, ci che dai non Italian
 mai esattamente uguale a ci che ricevi cos ho Italian
qualche bitorzolo, a cui sono affezionato, per: ciascuno mi ricorda Italian
l'affetto che ho condiviso. Altre volte invece ho dato via Italian
pezzi del mio cuore a persone che non mi hanno Italian
corrisposto: questo ti spiega le voragini. Amare  rischioso, certo, Italian
ma per quanto dolorose siano queste voragini che rimangono aperte Italian
nel mio cuore, mi ricordano sempre l'amore che provo anche Italian
per queste persone... e chiss? Forse un giorno ritorneranno, e Italian
magari colmeranno lo spazio che ho riservato per loro. Comprendi, Italian
adesso, che cosa sia la VERA bellezza?". Prese un pezzo Italian
del proprio cuore, and incontro al vecchio, e gliel' offr Italian
con le mani che tremavano. Il vecchio lo accett, lo Italian
mise nel suo cuore, poi prese un pezzo del suo Italian
vecchio cuore rattoppato e con esso colm la ferita rimasta Italian
aperta nel cuore del giovane. Ci entrava, ma non combaciava Italian
perfettamente, faceva un piccolo bitorzolo. Il giovane guard il suo Italian
cuore, che non era pi "il cuore pi bello del Italian
mondo", eppure lo trovava pi meraviglioso che mai: perch l'amore Italian
del vecchio ora scorreva dentro di lui. In questa storiella Italian
c' racchiusa un p di vita di tutte le persone..., Italian
ognuna con il suo cuore..., con i suoi bitorzoli, con Italian
i suoi vuoti..., e con tutto ci che nel corso Italian
degli anni si  donato e si  ricevuto... Alla Italian
fine ognuno di noi ha un qualcosa di importante... un Italian
qualcosa che rester per sempre dentro e che lo accompagner Italian
per tutta la vita. Cara Ariet, chi ti scrive  Italian
riesco a resistere all'impulso di dare senza considerare se sia Italian
giusto farlo per me o per il beneficiario. Leggo nei Italian
blog che questa  una problematica comune e perdona se Italian
sar prolissa, spero che serva a qualcosa.... Tutto ruota attorno Italian
al fatto di essere accettate/approvate e di conseguenza sentirsi apprezzate/amate. Italian
In realt con il nostro altruismo ad oltranza alimentiamo una Italian
ruota di distruzione: dando a piene mani agli altri, creiamo Italian
una dipendenza che stritola noi e rende succube dei nostri Italian
servizi il beneficiato. Quando umanamente non siamo pi in grado Italian
di dare, perch esauste/esaurite, siamo tacciate DI EGOISMO! Questo  Italian
un circolo vizioso che porta solo distruzione, MAI alla riconscenza Italian
o all'amore. Anzi pi ti sfruttano pi ti usano come Italian
pezza da piedi. Bisogna prima di tutto RISPETTARE ED AMARE Italian
SE STESSI, solo raggiungendo un equilibrio con noi stessi siamo Italian
in grado di aiutare in modo costruttivo gli altri. Se Italian
qualcuno protesta e tu spieghi tranquillamente, che certe cose hai Italian
smesso di farle perch non ce la fai, capir chi Italian
ti vuol bene, oppure  onesto e ti resta amico. Italian
Se nel tuo sano egoismo perdi qualche conoscenza per strada, Italian
RINGRAZIA IL CIELO: ERA UN PARASSITA !! In fare questo Italian
devi combattere il senso di inadeguatezza che sale, quando ci Italian
troviamo incapaci a fare le SUPERDONNE che REGALANO anche il Italian
cuore.... senza riserve, ma il % delle volte muoiono avvizzite Italian
dentro, con l'anima ed il cuore a pezzi... Pensa, mio Italian
marito un giorno mi disse: TI HO DATO TUTTO. Ho Italian
avuto il coraggio di rispondergli : NO, TU MI HAI Italian
DATO TUTTO QUELLO CHE TU PENSAVI MI ANDASSE BENE, SENZA Italian
CHIEDERMI SE ERO D'ACCORDO, ANZI NON HAI MAI ASCOLTATO QUANDO Italian
TI CHIEDEVO CIO' CHE VOLEVO, CHE ERA L'ESATTO CONTRARIO DI Italian
CIO' CHE MI DAVI.... ma tu pensavi che io non Italian
sapessi ci che era meglio per me!!! Mio marito ha Italian
sbagliato in buona fede... ma di buone intenzioni  lascricata Italian
la strada per l'inferno... quanta sofferenza in meno se solo Italian
mi avesse ascoltata.....e se io fossi stata pi forte a Italian
DIRE DI NO, BASTA. CORAGGIO, SII FORTE, GETTA VIA OGNI Italian

SODDISFATTA ARIET !! Un abbraccio Renata P.S. Maiuscolo : non Italian
stavo gridando, solo rafforzando il pensiero !!! ;D "Una cosa Italian
che mi da un fastidio tremendo  il ricevere quelle Italian
email collettive dove il mio nome, cognome e indirizzo di Italian
posta elettronica si trovano insieme a decine di altri destinatari. Italian
Un buglione di dati personali, rastrellati dalla rubrica di outlook, Italian
e ostensi a cani e porci leggasi spammer. Oggi ho Italian
avuto uno scambio di email con un'amica, anche lei giustamente Italian
infastidita da un orrido ppt, inviatoci da un'amica comune in Italian
un messaggio collettivo senza aver avuto cura di nascondere gli Italian
indirizzi dei destinatari. Cos il mio nome, cognome ed email Italian
sono finiti per l'ennesima volta in una lista, insieme a Italian
molti altri dati personali di sconosciuti e non, che sta Italian
andando in giro per la rete. Ma porca miseria. Forse Italian
non tutti sanno che esiste il campo ccn o bcc Italian
se si usa un client di posta in inglese fatto Italian
apposta per inviare i messaggi di posta elettronica in copia Italian
nascosta. In questo modo quando ci sono tanti destinatari nessuno Italian
pu vedere gli indirizzi degli altri. Mi spiego meglio con Italian
un esempio pratico. Mettiamo che ho il solito ppt bruttissimo, Italian
pieno di foto sgranate di gattini in pose buffe o Italian
di consigli parafilosofici in comic sans sul prendere di petto Italian
la vita, e che desideri ardentemente condividerlo con tutti quelli Italian
che conosco. Benissimo! Per prima cosa inoltro la mail, magari Italian
avendo cura di cancellare i testi passati che si accumulano Italian
di forward in forward, e scrivendoci tre parole carine del Italian
tipo : "cari amici vi inoltro questo simpatico messaggio, ciao Italian
gattasorniona". Poi ci metto gli indirizzi dei destinatari nel campo Italian
ccn eventualmente nel campo A posso scriverci di nuovo il Italian
mio indirizzo. Infine lo invio. Tutto chiaro? Cos sarete l'amico/a Italian
che manda le cazzate e basta e non l'amico/a che, Italian
oltre a inviare cazzate, getta gli indirizzi email in rubrica Italian
in pasto agli spammer... mi sembra un grosso guadagno. santo Italian
cielo. " categoria: amici di ariet Avere solo amici coppie, Italian
ti fa sentire necessariamente la diversa del gruppo. Per questo Italian
la maggior parte dei singles non esce abitualmente con le Italian
coppiette . "Reggere il moccolo" sta a significare che, inevitabilmente, Italian
ci si sente a disagio, per una ragione o per Italian
l'altra. E se poi ti ritagli il ruolo di mediatrice Italian
tra le coppie in crisi, di confidente, ecc. resterai sempre Italian
sola e triste. E sarai sempre considerata la sfigata del Italian
gruppo. Non  cos difficile fare nuove amicizie e i Italian
singles sono di tutte le et. Tra i quarantenni c' Italian
di tutto: zitellone, scapoloni, separati, divorziati, ecc. ecc. La rete Italian
 piena di single. Anche la blogsfera pullula di anime Italian
solitarie che non trovano requie, che vagolano per l'etere in Italian
cerca di sfoghi, di spalle virtuali a cui appoggiarsi, di Italian
tecnomaroni da spappolare con lamenti, da consigli da chiedere. Io Italian
ne sto diventando una regina. Quasi quasi mi spiacerebbe non Italian
esserlo pi, magari trovare un compagno e appendere il mouse Italian
al chiodo, perch tanto c' LUI, il mio AMOOOOOORRRRREEEEEEE a Italian
sopportarmi e a volermi bene e a farsi spappolare i Italian
gioielli di famiglia. Che vita triste e monotona... i messaggini Italian
teneri "buongiorno amore" o "sono arrivata al lavoro tesoro", sabato Italian
a girare col carrello tra le corsie dell'iper, domenica pranzo Italian
dai suoceri e sera al cinema coi popcorn... e le Italian
uscite con le altre coppie a lamentarsi del rispettivo partner Italian
in bagno, mentre i lui discutono di calcio o di Italian
formula uno... E la ricerca spasmodica dei ragali: compleanno, sanvalentino, Italian
anniversario, natale, onomastico. E passare i weekend a stirare camicie, Italian
ad attaccare bottoni, a raccogliere ci che semina per casa, Italian
mentre lui  divanizzato davanti alla playstation... Premetto che fino Italian
a circa anni fa non sapevo neanche accendere un pc Italian
e fino a anni fa non sapevo cosa fosse internet, Italian
quindi ho fatto passi da gigante. Il computer era nel Italian
mio immaginario una brutta bestia da sfidare, mentre una collega Italian
di allora ne era gi stata rapita e ci martellava Italian
le ovaie a tutte con i suoi corsi. Per da Italian
l l'odio si  tramutato piano piano, come nei migliori Italian
romanzi rosa, in una storia d'amore. Prima con quello di Italian
scuola, poi con quello di mio padre, molto pi tecnologico Italian
di me nonostante i suoi anni, infine da anni col Italian
mio pc personale, sempre portatile, sempre lento, sempre economico, ma Italian
funzionale. Mi ci sono appassionata e me lo portavo ovunque, Italian
anche sul letto. Ho riempito l'hard disk con la mia Italian
vita, le mie storie, le mie emozioni, le email pi Italian
belle, le chattate storiche, con tanti copia incolla, tante cartelle, Italian
ognuna per un momento particolare, una persona particolare... Io ho Italian
una stile molto sobrio, casual, ma personale, e ne vado Italian
orgogliosa. So come sentirmi elegante ma non ridicola, comoda ma Italian
non sciatta, originale ma non pacchiana. E ribadisco SENTIRMI, che Italian
non vuol dire ESSERE. Spesso un' "amica" mi ha accusata Italian
di essere trasandata, di non curarmi, di non truccarmi, di Italian
non valorizzarmi. Be, mi spiace, ma per me il valore Italian
non  nel come ci si veste o come ci Italian
si trucca. E ne sono felice. Non ho voglia di Italian
perdere mezzora di sonno prezioso per impiastriccarmi il viso o Italian
di passare ore davanti all'armadio aperto per decidere cosa mettere. Italian
Vado a istinto e metto quello che non  nel Italian
cestone della biancheria sporca. Forse anche il portafoglio fa la Italian
differenza ma solo per quel che riguarda la qualit non Italian
certo la griffe. Anch'io considero dei poveretti quelli che sputtanano Italian
i soldi nell'abbigliamento. Io piuttosto se ce li avessi mi Italian
faccio dei viaggi da paura. Ma contenti loro, contenti tutti. Italian
Penso sinceramente che io non ho trovato nessun pretesto per Italian
offendere le persone con ingiurie ! e tantomeno ho fatto Italian
marcia indietro perch sottoscrivo tutto ci che ho postato. Se Italian
ti va, leggiti un p il mio blog e capirai Italian
che quel post  coerente con il mio stile di Italian
scrittura che pu, anche quello, far cagare, piacere o meno Italian
ci mancherebbe. Sempre se ti va leggi anche il commento Italian
che ho scritto a proposito di quel post, ti avviso Italian
che "sono frasi ad effetto" e forse capirai magari non Italian
accettandolo ci che volevo dire. Sono arrivata davanti a casa Italian
dopo essere stata dalla parrucchiera, dove vado ogni mesi, ma Italian
giusto per non sembrare una homeless. Ovviamente inizia a piovere Italian
a dirotto e sono senza ombrello quello che ho sempre Italian
in macchina, a due piazze, per quando ho mille borse Italian

scorsa allora sto un po' in macchina e aspetto che Italian

che io eludo camminando coprendomi gli occhi. Poi arriva il Italian
freschino di sera, serve il giacchino, basta canotte e ascelle Italian
pezzate. E arrivano in ordine sparso gli amici dalle varie Italian
vacanze, ricolmi di abbronzatura, filmini e foto da vedere in Italian
serate allucinanti, ricordi e racconti. Ma  anche questo il Italian
bello delle amicizie, la voglia di condividere le cose vissute. Italian

ma a gennaio la gente si  data un gran Italian
da fare, eh? per con spettacolo a sorpresa in realt Italian
si sa gi chi lo fa, ma sar per me Italian
una sorpresa, in quanto non ho mai assistito ad un Italian
drag queen show! E non ne vedo l'ora.... Stamattina pensavo Italian
al vivere da soli. S, ogni tanto mi partono le Italian
riflessioni, a volte anche a voce alta. Pensavo a come Italian
farei fatica ad adattarmi a tempi, modi, spazi altrui. Pensavo Italian
alle convivenze che vedo e a quanto mi sembrano solo Italian
un ripiego al non saper vivere la solitudine o singletudine. Italian
E' il solito discorso trito e ritrito del "Meglio male Italian
accompagnati che soli". Ma io in certe occasioni mi sento Italian
una privilegiata. La cosa peggiore  che non se ne Italian
accorgono, i tapini, o non vogliono farlo vedere agli altri, Italian
vogliono recitare la commedia della coppia felice, che gira, fa Italian
cose, viaggia, mette su casa, sceglie la cucina, parla al Italian
plurale e divide la pizza. Poi lo sguardo dice altro, Italian
perch gli occhi non mentono, e leggi tanta insoddisfazione, tanta Italian
tristezza, tanta voglia di andarsene, tanta invidia per te che Italian
fai quello che vuoi. Insomma piantiamola con tutte queste critiche Italian
strumentali sulla ministra gelmini, con le facili polemiche sulle sue Italian
importanti riforme, col denigrare questa grande opera di modernizzazione mascherata Italian
da ritorno agli antichi sistemi! Se il governo ha messo Italian
la fiducia sul suo decreto, non vedo perch non dovremmo Italian
mettercela noi, popolo di tele elettori di questa isola dei Italian
famosi camuffata da parlamento! Per esempio si  fatto tutto Italian
un gran mugugno sulla riesumazione del grembiule come divisa obbligatoria, Italian
ma chi si attacca a questo stupido pretestino eretto a Italian
simbolo di un arretramento cronologico della scuola non sa guardare Italian
al di l del proprio naso, ed  totalmente privo Italian
di fantasia nonch di senso della modernizzazione estetica. Mica si Italian
burqa nero con collettino bianco applicabile per distinguere i maschi Italian
dalle femmine! Chi ha in testa questa archeologica immagine da Italian
libro cuore deve davvero darsi una rinfrescata alle idee, perch Italian
arguta ministra di zucca mica ha in mente un riciclo Italian
per il lancio di collezioni adatte a una generazione che, Italian
pur rimanendo fedele alle usanze dei progenitori, sa rinnovarsi e Italian
reinventarsi. Praticamente gi sicuro il lancio di Winx "Bitch at Italian
School", un grembiulino due pezzi top pi gonnellino inguinale in Italian
tessuto sintetico color fucsia, con seni siliconici applicati sul petto Italian
per sentirsi studentesse mature. Adattissimo alle scolarette disinibite e ai Italian
loro compagni maschietti con le idee gi chiare sul loro Italian
transessualismo a venire. Per i bambini pi classicamente virili, invece, Italian
una versione Gym Club della divisa scolastica, in microfibra aderente Italian
sul petto per mostrare promettenti pre muscoli da pre tronista, Italian
e forata sul retro della zona vita per non perdere Italian
la sana abitudine di mostrare al mondo le proprie mutande. Italian
Gi annunciata una reazione commerciale della famosa catena di abbigliamento Italian
adulti disegnato da Madonna, sta facendo produrre in Cina da Italian
bambini in et tra i e gli anni che, per Italian
chiare affinit, meglio possono comprendere e interpretare le esigenze dei Italian
consumatori finali una linea di sexy grembiuli ispirati alla favola Italian
Valeria Marini, la quale, non avendo mai finito le elementari, Italian
vuole provare a riscattarsi presentando una collezione di sottovesti in Italian
due linee di colori: rosa per chi va a scuola Italian
solo la mattina e nero seta per chi invece frequenta Italian
il tempo pieno. Insomma non bisogna preoccuparsi: se la gelmini Italian
ci assicura che avremo novit e modernizzazione dobbiamo crederci, perch Italian
le avremo. Poi possiamo chiederci se oltre alle novit avremo Italian
anche dei miglioramenti, ma insomma mica si pu prendere tutto Italian
da un solo ministro! "Il cammino formativo si legge nel Italian
documento dovr essere interrotto nel caso in cui il candidato, Italian
nonostante il suo impegno, il sostegno dello psicologo o la Italian
psicoterapia, continuasse a manifestare incapacit ad affrontare realisticamente, sia pure Italian
con la gradualit di ogni crescita umana, le proprie gravi Italian
immaturit forti dipendenze affettive, notevole mancanza di libert nelle relazioni, Italian
eccessiva rigidit di carattere, mancanza di lealt, identit sessuale incerta, Italian
tendenze omosessuali fortemente radicate, ecc. Lo stesso aggiunge il documento Italian
deve valere anche nel caso in cui risultasse evidente la Italian
difficolt a vivere nel celibato, vissuto come un obbligo cos Italian
pesante da compromettere l'equilibrio affettivo e relazionale". Nel la congregazione Italian
vaticana responsabile dell'educazione pubblic una 'Istruzione circa i criteri di Italian

della loro ammissione al seminario e agli ordini sacri'. L'iniziativa Italian
venne assunta sulla scia dello scandalo pedofilia negli Stati Uniti, Italian
anche se, all'interno della stessa Chiesa cattolica, diverse voci si Italian
levarono contro una connessione tra pedofilia e omosessualit. "Se per Italian
fare il prete il requisito principale e' la castita', ovvero Italian
la, impossibile, rinuncia a qualsiasi attivita' di carattere genitale, l'orientamento Italian

veleno dell'esclusione e del La voce di Maria in sottofondo. Italian
Ogni tanto interrotta dal jingle del programma. E' sabato e Italian
sono ancora a casa. Sto bene. Ho ancora tante domande Italian
dentro, ma sto bene. D'altronde bisogna stare bene. Cosa cambierebbe Italian
stando male? Un bel niente. Sono una cretina, lo so. Italian
Mi chiedo fino a quando rester tale, quando mi decider Italian
a cambiare. Una settimana pesantuccia sulle spalle e voglia di Italian
andarmene da tutto e da tutti. Il Folletto che non Italian
aspira, poi la micra che non parte, l'acqua torrenziale e Italian
il vento, brutte notizie in famiglia, euro di gas, un Italian
amore che non parte e forse non era nemmeno amore, Italian
il fondo di istituto che non arriva e io che Italian
ho gi finito i soldi del mese, un amico che Italian
mi vuole allontanare e non capisco perch, un cuore troppo Italian
vuoto. Ma non voglio caderci. Guardo le bottiglie sulla mensola. Italian
Il nocino, l'erba luisa, la grappa, il mirto. No, Cri, Italian
non farlo. Resisti. S, ma per cosa? Per stare ancora Italian
come sabato scorso? Con l'emicrania da nervoso? Sapevo che ci Italian
sarei cascata. Accendo il pc e mi metto invisibile in Italian
msn, tanto se entra lo vedo. Controllo la bacheca di Italian
facebook, niente. Leggo la sua, niente. Ieri pomeriggio sono andata Italian
all'Ikea di Parma con un amico. Dovevamo andare la scorsa Italian
settimana, ma ero reduce dall'influenza e non volevo rischiare di Italian
strapazzarmi. Avevamo quasi finito il giro, carichi come muli, ed Italian
eccolo.... IL TERREMOTO! Subito ho sentito una vibrazione del pavimento, Italian
come quando passa un camion o un treno vicino, poi Italian
dopo qualche secondo ecco la scossa, gli scaffali dondolano, lo Italian
stomaco si blocca in uno spasmo... la gente ride, come Italian
se niente fosse... poi, dopo minuti, ci fanno uscire, evacuazione, Italian
procedura di emergenza, etc etc. Fuori, al freddo, tutti incazzati Italian
e nervos, attaccati ai telefonini. Dopo minuti si rientra e Italian
tutto torna normale. postato da ariet alle ore : | Italian

ce l'hanno con i bisesti, ma io ho fatto un'eccezione. Italian
Io sono nata in un anno bisestile, tanto per dirne Italian
una. E poi in fondo anche le cose peggiori che Italian
mi sono capitate non sono state drammatiche. Una cosa importante Italian
 successa, ed  giusto che lo segnali qui: ho Italian
ricominciato a provare emozioni che pensavo di avere perso, Qualcosa Italian
che assomiglia all'amore, un batticuore, una fitta allo stomaco. E' Italian
stato come rinascere. E anche se non  andata bene, Italian
va bene lo stesso. Ho riscoperto una Cristina che non Italian
volevo pi vedere, che avevo seppellito sotto una corazza di Italian
autosuffcienza e di ironia, una Cristina che soffre e che Italian
ama, che vuole amare, ancora, dopo tanti anni. E voglio Italian
che tutti coloro che leggeranno queste parole sappiano cosa sento, Italian
e se vorranno criticare o giudicare o sputare sentenze o Italian
provocare o capire quello che si vuole, per comodit, sappiano Italian
che io sono contenta di quello che sono, anche con Italian
tutti i miei difetti che non rinnego, e, se sbaglier, Italian
sapr sempre avere l'umilt di confrontarmi con chi mi sapr Italian
guardare negli Stanotte ero a letto, leggendo un libro, mentre Italian
al di l del muro cantavano il karaoke. Eppure non Italian
ero infastidita, anzi. Sto scoprendo il piacere di stare bene Italian
anche da sola, facendo solo le cose che mi piacciono Italian
solo con chi mi piace. Basta beneficienza, come dice il Italian
mio cucciolo. Un tempo ero sempre fuori, cercavo sempre gente Italian
intorno a me, organizzavo, chiamavo, mi facevo in quattro, proponevo. Italian
Per non era mai abbastanza, mi sentivo comunque sola. E Italian
quando tornavo in casa e chiudevo la porta dietro di Italian
me, entravo nell'incubo. Quella casa era l'inferno della mia solitudine, Italian
faceva esplodere la mia sofferenza. Quando si sta male con Italian
se stessi non c' nessuno che possa colmare la solitudine. Italian
postato da ariet alle ore : | Permalink | commenti Italian
 / commenti  pop up Abbiamo chattato per un Italian
paio di mesi su msn, parlando del pi e del Italian
meno. Sembrava una persona interessante, almeno da conoscere di persona. Italian
Poi abbiamo deciso di vederci, per un te nel pomeriggio. Italian
Io, sempre molto sospettosa, decido luogo pubblico e ora strategica: Italian
se non va, ci si defila per la serata; se Italian
va, si proseguono le danze. Arrivo all'appuntamento con un sorriso Italian
smagliante, il rossetto e in tiro da grandi occasioni. Lui Italian
molto sobrio: jeans e maglia di cachemire, camicia e un Italian
simpatico basco. Ma gi l'impatto visivo non  dei migliori. Italian
Le foto a volte traggono in inganno. Ci salutiamo dandoci Italian
la mano e presentandoci, io provo a tentare un bacetto Italian
sulle guance ma non colgo reciprocit e rinuncio. Ci sediamo Italian
e ordiniamo. La conversazione langue, siamo impacciati e non so Italian
come e cosa dire. Infilo una serie di banalit e Italian
lui mi segue a ruota. Provo a dire qualche battuta Italian
per sdrammatizzare e lui non le capisce. Dopo un'ora avevo Italian
gi un altissimo tasso di scassamento di coglioni. Gli argomenti Italian
si susseguono nell'ordine: il tempo, il lavoro di lui, il Italian
lavoro mio, la fotografia, i suoi corsi di fotografia, le Italian
sue fotografie che ho gi visto su flickr e non Italian
mi piacciono, il concetto di fotografia, l'attrezzatura del fotografo, le Italian
uscite fotografiche, il circolo fotografico. Io sostengo che non mi Italian
piacciono i corsi, che sono una fotografa istintiva, che non Italian
ho una tecnica, guardo nell'obiettivo e inquadro quello che mi Italian
trasmette qualcosa. Si discute su queste divergenze di opinioni per Italian
mezzora, e intanto guardo l'orologio per vedere quando posso finire Italian
questa agonia. Conclude l'incontro pagando solo per s e salutandomi Italian
dicendo: mi sa che Ariet  quella della Casa nella Italian
prateria. Il soprannome deriva da un discorso fatto durante la Italian
alcool che era in circolo in quanto io ho proclamato Italian
che non andr mai in bagno se  fuori, come Italian
avere il bagno in casa era Ariet Ollison, ecco il Italian
nome. In breve, L. si offre di accompagnarmi alla macchina. Italian
Scambiamo qualche parola banale e frasi di circostanza. Poi arrivati Italian
alla mia macchina, il casino. Ci baciamo, ci tocchiamo, ed Italian
 bellissimo, meraviglioso. Dura pochi minuti, siamo in un parcheggio Italian
sotto dei fari, ed  quello che ci salva. Se Italian
no, non so. L. era la mia anima gemella, il Italian
mio alter ego, eravamo simili in tutto. ma era terribilmente Italian
fidanzato, e, nonostante la crisi che viveva, o diceva di Italian
vivere, non l'ha mai lasciata. Io sono stata in sospeso Italian
per due anni, tra addii e ritorni, tra richieste di Italian
aiuto e sfuriate, tra insulti e coccole. Poi ho deciso Italian
di chiudere. non reggevo, non potevo. Ho trovato in questo Italian
mondo cos strano e imprevedibile una persona che mi ha Italian
saputo ascoltare e a cui mi sono sentita di mettermi Italian
a nudo, forse tutelata dalla distanza e dall'anonimato. Poi chiacchiera Italian
dopo chiacchiera, confidenza dopo confidenza, ci siamo scoperti molto simili, Italian
in sintonia, con un'affinit che sembrava impossibile trovare qui, nel Italian
virtuale. Io, diffidente all'ennesima potenza, chiusa come un riccio durante Italian
uno tzunami, mi sono sentita tranquilla e rilassata. Ho trovato Italian
una serenit che avevo dimenticato, mi sono affidata come una Italian
foglia al vento, mi sono detta: per una volta, ma Italian
chi se ne frega!!!! E il cuore ha ripreso dopo Italian
un paio d'anni a battere, quando vedevo il suo nome Italian
salire sulla finestrella di messenger... Lo scambio di foto, il Italian
raccontarsi tutto, poi gli sms, le telefonate... via via, sempre Italian
pi disponibile all'imponderabile... Proprio l'altra notte ho sognato quello che Italian
per ultimo mi ha fatto piangere tutte le sere. Non Italian
so perch, sono ben anni che non lo sento e Italian
almeno che non lo vedo. Ma i sogni son cos. Italian
Ogni tanto ho sognato degli ex amori, ma mi svegliavo Italian
sempre col sorriso. Stavolta mi son svegliata con le palpitazioni Italian
e le lacrime agli occhi. Ora sto raggiungendo un minimo Italian
di equilibrio e di serenit, ma lo dico piano perch Italian
so che pu crollare tutto da un momento all'altro. Ma Italian
questo vale per tutti, anche per chi  sposato da Italian
anni con figli, per chi ha la famigliola del mulino Italian
bianco. Non si  mai arrivati, mai. Questo bisogna saperlo Italian
e ricordarselo sempre. La cosa che mi ha sempre fatto Italian
bene, anche se subito mi sembrava impossibile da sopportare,  Italian
stata la separazione, il distacco da colui che mi dava Italian
dipendenza. Io ho sempre chiuso in modo drastico, con gli Italian
amori e con le amicizie. Credo che staccare completamente sia Italian
l'unico modo per disintossicarsi, per poi ritrovare, una volta ripuliti, Italian
la forza di rimboccarsi le maniche e andare oltre. E Italian
ora i sento soddisfatta, di quello che ho fatto della Italian
mia vita, di quello che sono ora. Non sar una Italian
nababba e non vado in ferie da anni, non sar Italian
una strafiga e a volte mi sembra di essere invisibile, Italian
ma sapete una cosa? Io mi piaccio, con i miei Italian
chili di troppo, con le ricrescita e le rughe. "Tu". Italian
E da un lato cerco di prepararmi a stare da Italian
sola tutta la vita, ad abituarmi all'idea di invecchiare da Italian
sola, di finire in un ospizio, senza figli che mi Italian
accudiscano negli ultimi anni. Da un altro ne sono terrorizzata. Italian
Ma non riesco a rimettermi in gioco, a buttarmi, conosco Italian
gente, certo, ma cerco di tutelarmi, di difendermi. No, cos Italian
non va. Ma non riesco a cambiare, mannaggia. Quest'estate ero Italian
convinta di aver trovato il modo. Avevo ricevuto un'email inaspettata Italian
dopo mesi da una persona che mi aveva interessato questa Italian
primavera, ed ero partita, come a vent'anni. Rispondo, lui mi Italian
risponde, io di nuovo, lui anche, insomma un bel po' Italian
di email. Lui  a Milano, io qui. Ma l'ultima Italian
 stata quella con l'annuncio del suo prossimo matrimonio e Italian
l'invito a Buon Natale alla mia mamma che ha fatto Italian
dei tortelli e degli agnoli squisiti. Buon Natale a mia Italian
sorella, e anche a mio cognato ... sgrunt! che hanno Italian
fatto una nipotina stupenda. Buon Natale ad un'amica che mi Italian
ha annunciato ieri notte di aspettare un bambino. Buon Natale Italian
ad un amico che mi ha regalato un film divertentissimo Italian
che mi ha tenuto compagnia e regalato risate a pi Italian
non posso. Buon Natale ad un'amica che mi  stata Italian
vicina con discrezione in un brutto momento. Buon Natale ad Italian
un amico che mi ha telefonato per farmi gli auguri Italian
e sapere come stavo. Buon Natale alla mia collega che Italian
mi ha dimostrato un affetto e una gratitudine che non Italian
mi aspettavo. Buon Natale ad un amico che mi ha Italian
fatto capire con uno sguardo e una bottiglia che, al Italian
di l di tutto, mi vuole bene. Buon Natale ad Italian
un'amica che ha chattato in msn tutto il pomeriggio, raccontandomi Italian
il menu del suo cenone e del suo pranzo e Italian
facendomi ingrassare solo a sentirla. Buon Natale ad un amico Italian
che si ricorda sempre di farmi gli auguri per primo. Italian
Buon Natale agli amici di questo blog, uno per uno, Italian
come se fossero qui attorno alla mia tavola con un Italian
bicchiere di spumante a festeggiare. Buon Natale all'amica che ho Italian
ritrovato dopo tanto tempo, e che pensavo di avere persa. Italian
Buon Natale a chi mi ha ascoltato e consigliato. Buon Italian
Natale a chi ho conosciuto, incontrato e creduto di amare, Italian
poi non ha saputo capirmi e aspettare. Buon Natale a Italian
chi non ho mai voluto incontrare per paura. Buon Natale Italian
agli amici di Roma che mi aspettano da mesi e Italian
che spero di abbracciare presto. Buon Natale a chi mi Italian
ha pensata in questi giorni. Buon Natale a chi sa Italian
essermi vicino senza tante menate e senza fronzoli. Per ho Italian
avuto lo stesso modo di ripercorrere questo anno, cos strano, Italian
bisestile e anomalo. Tutti ce l'hanno con i bisesti, ma Italian
io ho fatto un'eccezione. Io sono nata in un anno Italian
bisestile, tanto per dirne una. E poi in fondo anche Italian
le cose peggiori che mi sono capitate non sono state Italian
drammatiche. Una cosa importante  successa, ed  giusto che Italian

una Cristina che non volevo pi vedere, che avevo seppellito Italian
sotto una corazza di autosuffcienza e di ironia, una Cristina Italian
che soffre e che ama, che vuole amare, ancora, dopo Italian
tanti anni. Sull'onda della proposta lanciata oggi dalla trasmissione radio Italian
Fahrenheit, si  deciso con la partecipazione di tutte le Italian
associazioni della Casa della memoria e della Biblioteca di promuovere Italian
e organizzare per marted ottobre , dalle ore del mattino Italian
fino a sera una lettura collettiva e continuativa del libro Italian
di "Gomorra", di Roberto Saviano, in segno di solidariet con Italian
l'autore. Chiederei un contributo personale da parte di tutti, compatibilmente Italian
con gli impegni lavorativi ed extralavorativi a partecipare a questo Italian
evento, sia dei colleghi esperti nella lettura ad alta voce Italian
biblioteche. Ogni lettore firmer la pagina che avr letto, su Italian
di una copia del libro che rimarr in biblioteca come Italian
ricordo. Sono per una consumatrice, una che fa la spesa Italian
e acquista e volevo rendervi nota la mia intenzione a Italian
non mettere pi piede in nessuno dei vostri centri commerciali, Italian
non solo Carrefour ma nemmeno GS, DiperD, Docks e Gross Italian
che, a quanto vedo dal vostro sito, fanno parte del Italian
vostro circuito. Il motivo sta in quanto accaduto a Barbara, Italian
giovane mamma di un bimbo autistico che il giorno settembre Italian
ha subto un episodio di discriminazione e violenta umiliazione presso Italian
il vostro centro Carrefour di Assago. Quanto successo lo spiega Italian
molto bene Barbara in questo suo post che vi invito Italian
a leggervi e a rileggervi. Ho letteralmente il sangue alla Italian
testa, sono infuriata e addolorata e non sto nemmeno a Italian
scrivervi quanto immorale sia ogni forma di discriminazione messa in Italian
atto a carico di quanti ritenuti spesso a torto i Italian
pi deboli, che si tratti di donne, bambini, disabili o Italian
chiss che altro. Non serve che vi scriva in maniera Italian
approfondita quanto penso e sento perch ritengo che a voi, Italian
di quanto penso e sento, non importi proprio nulla. A Italian
voi interessa vendere, guadagnare, aumentare il business. Ed  l Italian
che siete sensibili. Nel guadagno. Per questo motivo non intendo Italian
pi lasciarvi un solo soldino. E chieder alle mie amiche Italian
di fare altrettanto e ai miei parenti, ai miei clienti, Italian
a tutte le persone che conosco. E pubblicher questa lettera Italian
sul mio blog chiedendo a chi mi legge di fare Italian
altrettanto. Io, al posto vostro, mi vergognerei. Almeno un pochino. Italian
L'anno trascorso ha visto spesso la volont popolare travisata, non Italian
rinnovamento di un sistema che non funziona, n in economia, Italian
n nella sanit, o nell'istruzione o nella politica, al rifiuto Italian
del nucleare nuovamente messo in discussione, al procrastinare sine die Italian
l'emissione di una legge che regolamenti la gestione dell'informazione, all'approvazione Italian
affrettata di un indulto di cui hanno beneficiato i soliti Italian
dei carcerati per reati minori. Neppure nel campo del lavoro Italian
si  verificato quel cambiamento di rotta, quella stabilizzazione che Italian
in tanti auspicavamo, in cui in tanti abbiamo creduto. Abbiamo Italian
assistito invece ad un'impressionante sequela di morti sul lavoro, la Italian
pi eclatante delle quali, sia per numero di vittime che Italian
hoc. Abbiamo assistito ad inchieste revocate, censure appioppate, esternazioni tollerate, Italian
richieste di grazia discutibili, prese di posizione indifendibili all'arrogarsi il Italian
diritto di cercare accordi di modifica a leggi statali da Italian
parte di chi non ne  legittimato perfino alla messa Italian
a punto di topi che non hanno paura dei gatti Italian
ma se invece di inventare qualcosa di cui nessuno sentiva Italian
la mancanza gli scienziati si impegnassero a realizzare il siero Italian
giudiziari? ESTE Capo chierichetto alla basilica delle Grazie dove  Italian
anche stato catechista e cantore alla messa del sabato, domenica Italian
mattina e sera. Dopo anni ieri sera Alberto Ruggin, anni, Italian
omosessuale, per la prima volta non si  presentato alla Italian
messa. Non per sua volont. A chiedergli di non farsi Italian
vedere  stato il parroco don Paolino col quale ieri Italian
ha avuto un lungo e difficile incontro. Il parroco lo Italian
ha accusato di non avergli mai raccontato nulla della sua Italian
omosessualit invitandolo espressamente a non farsi vedere. Ma le sorprese Italian
amare per Alberto, dopo aver confessato in pubblico la sua Italian
omosessualit ed aver partecipato alla trasmissione "Ciao Darwin" di Paolo Italian
Bonolis in onda marted sera su Canale , non sono Italian
finite. Molti conoscenti non lo salutano pi per strada. Nemmeno Italian
Forza Italia ha accolto la notizia con entusiasmo. Anzi. Qualche Italian
mugugno  stato espresso a chiare lettere ai responsabili del Italian
Circolo delle Libert di cui Alberto fa parte. Ma questi Italian
ultimi lo hanno difeso in modo fermo e convinto. La Italian
ferita che maggiormente gli brucia  essere stato escluso dalla Italian
messa. "Amare Ges Cristo per me  la cosa pi Italian
importante della vita dice come un fiume in piena don Italian
Paolino mi ha detto che non sono stato sincero con Italian
lui. Io ho risposto da cattolico praticante che in confessione Italian
ho sempre parlato della mia sessualit e di come la Italian
vivo. Sono sempre stato assolto. Mi ritengo riconciliato col Signore". Italian
"Sono deluso da una chiesa che parla di accoglienza e Italian
amore aggiunge di vicinanza ai bisognosi ma che nella pratica Italian
poi dimostra esattamente il contrario". "Quando insegnavo catechismo ho sempre Italian
detto che il per cento dei cattolici praticanti non apre Italian
gli occhi su chi sta fuori. Noi non siamo veri Italian
cristiani fuori dalla chiesa. C' gente che ieri mattina non Italian
mi salutava pi, che si volta da una altra parte, Italian
catechisti". Non  stato accolto calorosamente nemmeno dai forzisti. A Italian
difenderlo solo quelli del circolo". In Forza Italia di Este Italian
non mi rispecchio: ho come riferimento piuttosto Giancarlo Galan che Italian
parla di matrimoni tra omosessuali ed adozioni delle coppie gay". Italian
Per Este, cittadina perbenista, bianca per tradizione, ieri mattina  Italian
stata una domenica particolare. Uno dei suoi figli, praticante cattolico Italian
con grande convinzione, sempre in chiesa e al patronato, giacca Italian
e cravatta, senza grilli per la testa e con tanta Italian
e sbandiera ai quattro venti di essere omosessuale. E per Italian
questo viene ripreso dal parroco delle Grazie e invitato a Italian
non partecipare pi alla messa cantando nel coro. Nella fredda Italian
domenica autunnale ne parlano tutti. Lui  in piazza Maggiore, Italian
imperturbabile, con un sorriso per i suoi amici che lo Italian
sostengono, a raccogliere firme per mandare a casa il governo Italian
Prodi su iniziativa dei Circoli della libert di cui  Italian
fra i fondatori. Al pomeriggio incassa una telefonata di solidariet Italian
del presidente nazionale di Gaylib Enrico Oliari. Poi torna in Italian
piazza, convinto di non doversi vergognare. Sino ad una settimana Italian
fa Alberto Ruggin  stato un ragazzo come gli altri. Italian
Anzi  un giovane che molte mamme estensi vorrebbero avere. Italian
Frequenta la chiesa delle Grazie,  catechista da cinque anni, Italian
nel coro da sette. Prima  stato scout e animatore Italian
del Grest al Patronato Redentore. Ama il nuoto, che pratica Italian
da anni. Nel si iscrive a Forza Italia ed  Italian
tra i fondatori della sezione cittadina dei Circoli della libert Italian
di Michela Brambilla. Compir anni in dicembre, porta la giacca Italian
Liceo di Scienze sociali a Montagnana voto /, va a Italian
lavorare col padre Maurizio nella ditta MT che produce ferro Italian
battuto in zona industriale ed ha da poco un negozio: Italian
Excalibur, in via Cavour. Da oltre un anno frequenta locali Italian
gay padovani. Un amico gli propone di partecipare alla trasmissione Italian
Ciao Darwin condotta da Paolo Bonolis e Luca Laurenti su Italian
Canale : la sfida sar omo contro eterosessuali. Lui accetta Italian
e venerd scorso va a Roma dove registra la trasmissione Italian
che andr in onda marted sera. Prima per parla col Italian
Mattino della sua partecipazione e, con disinvoltura, confessa la sua Italian
omosessualit. Io sto bene, mi hanno chiesto di partecipare al Italian
gioco e mi hanno detto di far vedere il meglio Italian
di me dice Non bisogna vergognarsi di essere quello che Italian
si . Una persona non si giudica per quello che Italian
fa sotto le coperte. La vera democrazia si vede quando Italian
si ha rispetto delle minoranze. Credo di dar voce a Italian
molti altri omosessuali. Ce ne sono anche ad Este. Conosco Italian
se ne parli . Il Veneto e la Lombardia sono Italian
le sole regioni dove i gay votano in prevalenza per Italian
gay sono di sinistra. Poi basta vedere la politica di Italian
Sarkozy in Francia. A parte il caso Zapatero, vediamo che Italian
anche in Olanda, Belgio, persino in Croazia, Ungheria ci sono Italian
i pacs. Apprezzo molto le posizioni di Giancarlo Galan, ma Italian
anche di Chiara Moroni o Marco Taradash. Non quelle invece Italian
di Forza Italia estense, composta da ex democristiani, piuttosto bigotta Italian
se non fascista. A Trentin rispondo che nel mio sito Italian
retta alla Lega, apprezzo di pi le esternazioni di Fini. Italian
Faccio un appello anche ad Alessandro Zan affinch se ne Italian
continui a parlare . Mi sembrava doveroso far sapere che Italian
creato io. Tutto sarebbe finito l se don Paolino non Italian
mi avesse imposto di non partecipare al coro. Mi ha Italian
certamente il tuo parroco non ha capito il grande valore Italian
della scelta che hai fatto quando hai deciso di non Italian
nascondere p la tua omosessualit. Non c' infatti nulla di Italian
male nell'essere attratti da una persona del proprio sesso. Il Italian
male  piuttosto legato all'ipocrisia in cui spesso si vive Italian
questa condizione. Tu hai scelto di abbandonare questa ipocrisia e, Italian
cos facendo, hai senz'altro fatto la volont di Dio: Ges, Italian
infatti, nel Vangelo, non condanna mai l'omosessualit, mentre spesso usa Italian
parole molto dure nei confronti dell'ipocrisia. E' quindi dall'abbandono dell'ipocrisia Italian
che inizia il cammino di conversione a cui il Signore Italian
ci chiama. Continua a pregare caro Alberto, continua ad animare Italian
le liturgie a cui partecipi, ma soprattutto, continua a cantare, Italian
perch il tuo canto, adesso,  senz'altro molto pi gradito Italian
a Dio. E vedrai che alla fine, non solo il Italian

ha trivializado la civilizacin de nuestro tiempo de tal modo Spanish
que acaben por convertir lo en un ejercicio sin misterio Spanish
disociado modo a las futuras generaciones de una fuente de Spanish
placer que irrig hasta ahora de manera tan fecunda la Spanish
imaginacin y la creatividad de los seres humanos La vacuidad Spanish
y chabacanera que han ido socavando la cultura han estropeado Spanish
tambin en cierta forma otra de las ms importantes conquistas Spanish
de nuestra poca en los pases democrticos : la liberacin Spanish
sexual el eclipse de muchos tabes y prejuicios que rodeaban Spanish
la vida ertica Porque a el igual que en los Spanish
dominios de el arte y la literatura la desaparicin de Spanish
las formas en la vida sexual no significa un progreso Spanish
sino ms bien un retroceso que desnaturaliza la libertad y Spanish
empobrece el sexo rebajndo lo a lo puramente instintivo y Spanish
animal La masturbacin no necesita ser enseada ella se descubre Spanish
en la intimidad y es uno de los quehaceres que Spanish
fundan la vida privada Ella va desgajando a el nio Spanish
a la nia de su entorno familiar individualizndo los y Spanish
sensibilizndo los a el revelar les el mundo secreto de Spanish
los deseos e instruyndo los sobre asuntos capitales como placer Spanish
Por eso destruir los ritos privados y acabar con la Spanish
discrecin y el pudor que desde que la sociedad humana Spanish
alcanz la civilizacin han acompaado a el sexo no es Spanish
combatir un prejuicio sino amputar de la vida sexual aquella Spanish
dimensin que fue surgiendo en torno suyo a medida que Spanish
la cultura y el desarrollo de las artes y las Spanish
letras iban enriquecindo la y convirtindo la a ella misma Spanish
en obra de arte Sacar a el sexo de las Spanish
alcobas para exhibir lo en la plaza pblica es paradjicamente Spanish
no liberalizar lo sino regresar lo a los tiempos de Spanish
la caverna cuando como los monos y los perros las Spanish
parejas no haban aprendido todava a hacer el amor slo Spanish
a ayuntar se La supuesta liberacin de el sexo uno Spanish
de los rasgos ms acusados de la modernidad en las Spanish
sociedades occidentales dentro de la cual se inscribe esta idea Spanish
de dar clases de masturbacin en las escuelas quiz consiga Spanish
abolir ciertos prejuicios tontos sobre el onanismo En buena hora Spanish
Pero tambin podra acaso acabe con l  Quin saldra Spanish
ganando ? No los libertarios ni los libertinos sino los Spanish
puritanos y las iglesias Y continuara el delirio y la Spanish
futilizacin de el amor que caracterizan a la civilizacin contempornea Spanish
en el mundo occidental La idea de los talleres de Spanish
masturbacin es un nuevo eslabn en el movimiento que para Spanish
poner le una fecha de nacimiento  aunque en verdad Spanish
es anterior  comenz en Pars en Mayo de y Spanish
pretende poner fin a los obstculos y prevenciones de carcter Spanish
religioso e ideolgico que desde tiempos inveterados han reprimido la Spanish
vida sexual provocando innumerables sufrimientos sobre todo a las mujeres Spanish
y a las minoras sexuales as como frustracin neurosis y Spanish
otros desequilibrios psquicos en quienes debido a la rigidez de Spanish
la moral reinante se han visto discriminados censurados y condenados Spanish
a una insegura clandestinidad Este movimiento ha tenido saludables consecuencias Spanish
desde luego en los pases occidentales aunque en otras culturas Spanish
como la islmica ha exacerbado las prohibiciones y la represin Spanish
El la mujer se ha evaporado y gracias a el Spanish

el mismo sexo con los mismos derechos que los de Spanish
las parejas heterosexuales incluido el de adoptar nios Y tambin Spanish
de manera paulatina se extiende la idea de que en Spanish
materia sexual lo que hagan o dejen de hacer entre Spanish
el os los adultos en uso de razn y decisin Spanish
es prerrogativa suya y nadie empezando por el Estado y Spanish
terminando por las iglesias debe inmiscuir por supuesto Pero es Spanish
un error creer como los promotores de este movimiento liberador Spanish
que desacralizndo lo desvistindo lo de las veladuras el pudor Spanish

a los cuales el sexo se civiliz y humaniz Con Spanish
sexo pblico sano y normal la vida se volvera ms Spanish
aburrida mediocre y violenta de lo que es Hay muchas Spanish
formas de definir el erotismo pero tal vez la principal Spanish

a el progreso de la libertad y la influencia de Spanish
la cultura en la vida privada de mera satisfaccin de Spanish
una pulsin instintiva en un quehacer creativo y compartido que Spanish
prolonga y sublima el placer fsico rodendo lo de una Spanish
puesta en escena y unos refinamientos que lo convierten en Spanish
obra de arte Tal vez en ninguna otra actividad se Spanish
haya ido estableciendo una frontera tan evidente entre lo animal Spanish
y lo humano como en el dominio de el sexo Spanish
Esta diferencia en un principio en la noche de los Spanish
tiempos no exista y confunda a ambos en un acoplamiento Spanish

freno alguno acarrea enloquecidas violencias pues es el vehculo privilegiado Spanish
a travs de el cual se manifiestan los instintos ms Spanish
destructivos de la personalidad Lo ideal en este dominio es Spanish
que las fronteras dentro de las cuales se despliega la Spanish
vida sexual se ensanchen lo suficiente para que hombres y Spanish
mujeres puedan actuar con libertad volcando en ella sus deseos Spanish
y fantasmas sin sentir se amenazados ni discriminados pero dentro Spanish
de ciertas formas culturales que preserven a el sexo su Spanish
naturaleza privada e ntima de manera que la vida sexual Spanish
no se banalice ni animalice Eso es el erotismo Con Spanish

y a la teatralidad nace como un producto de la Spanish
alta las gentes primitivas y bastas pues se trata de Spanish
un quehacer que exige sensibilidad refinada cultura literaria y artstica Spanish
y cierta vocacin transgresora Transgresora es una palabra que en Spanish
este caso hay que tomar con pinzas pues dentro de Spanish
el contexto ertico no significa negacin de la regla moral Spanish
o religiosa imperante sino ambas cosas a la vez : Spanish
su reconocimiento y su rechazo mezclados de manera indisoluble Violando Spanish
la norma en la intimidad con discrecin y de comn Spanish

representacin un juego teatral que inflama su placer con un Spanish
aderezo de desafo y libertad a la vez que preserva Spanish
a el sexo el estatuto de quehacer velado confidencial y Spanish
secreto Sin el cuidado de las formas de ese ritual Spanish
que a la vez que enriquece prolonga y sublima el Spanish
placer el acto sexual retorna a ser un ejercicio puramente Spanish
fsico una pulsin de la naturaleza en el organismo humano Spanish
de la que el hombre y la mujer son meros Spanish
instrumentos pasivos el o nos ilustra sin pretender lo ni Spanish

de la libertad Los tal eres de masturbacin a los Spanish

como parte de el currculo escolar tienen la apariencia de Spanish
un paso audaz el dominio sexual En la realidad es Spanish
probable que esta y otras iniciativas semejantes destinadas a desacralizar Spanish
la vida sexual convirtindo la en una prctica tan comn Spanish
y corriente como comer dormir e ir a el trabajo Spanish

proporciona innegables beneficios de carcter educativo social y de ocio Spanish
Sin embargo tambin existen una serie de riesgos relacionados con Spanish
las TIC que pueden afectar de forma especial a los Spanish
menores Por ello para que nios y adolescentes puedan disfrutar Spanish
de las TIC en toda su extensin y aprovechar las Spanish
mltiples posibilidades que estas les ofrecen es clave que sepan Spanish
cules son sus riesgos y conozcan la forma de afrontar Spanish
los De ese modo tambin aumentar la confianza de sus Spanish
padres hacia las TIC y su incorporacin a la sociedad Spanish
de el conocimiento Hoy da todos y todas sabemos que Spanish
internet y las nuevas Tecnologas de la Informacin y la Spanish
Comunicacin  TIC  tienen una presencia muy importante en Spanish
nuestras vidas cotidianas Mucho ms en la vida de los Spanish
nios nias y jvenes que por haber nacido en un Spanish
entorno dominado por la presencia tecnolgica acceden con ms facilidad Spanish
que Y lo hacen con tal grado de pericia destreza Spanish
y adaptacin que sugerencias y experiencias a ese mundo que Spanish
abren las nuevas TIC y que tantas posibilidades educativas nos Spanish
propone  Qu suelen hacer los nios y jvenes con Spanish
las TIC ?  Qu hacen con internet ? Es Spanish
importante partir de un concepto Las TIC hoy da son Spanish
un medio indispensable de la socializacin y de la construccin Spanish
identitaria Los nios nias y jvenes se construyen a ellos Spanish
mismos de forma permanente cuando utilizan las TIC Las imgenes Spanish
que deciden mostrar de ellos mismos o de las cosas Spanish
que les gustan y prefieren los relatos que deciden resaltar Spanish
y con los que eligen fragmentos de la realidad las Spanish
modas que publicitan las elecciones estticas y artsticas sus historias Spanish

referida a temas de su inters o los fanticos de Spanish
los blogs y los foros cuando eligen algunos de los Spanish
cientos que hay en la red para discutir con habitantes Spanish
de lugares remotos sobre un tema comn o intercambiar informacin Spanish
vlida sobre el mismo Las TIC los acompaan como tutores Spanish
celosos en sus tareas escolares cotidianas y en muchos casos Spanish
los nios no solo aprovechan la facilidad de el Copiar Spanish
y Pegar que permite la web sino que buscan informacin Spanish
la comparan con otra seleccionan editan complementan con ideas propias Spanish
etc En ese trabajo aun cuando no le pongan ese Spanish
nombre contrastan fuentes de informacin Los nios las nias y Spanish
los jvenes juegan en red o con juegos en de Spanish
soportes tcnicos Hay miles de juegos on line que los Spanish
distraen y en algunos casos estos juegos se transforman en Spanish
verdaderas compaas a falta de amigos cercanos o padres sin Spanish
tiempo a causa de las ocupaciones cotidianas Incluso son refugio Spanish
para los chicos a los que no les dejan salir Spanish
por problemas de inseguridad Las TIC permiten tambin mantener encendida Spanish
la llama de el vnculo familiar sobre todo cuando los Spanish
seres queridos y muy cercanos estn separados por la distancia Spanish
de ciudades o pases Los jvenes tambin se dan a Spanish
conocer a travs de sus propias webs blogs o fotologs Spanish
donde aprovechan para subir informacin que les retrate de la Spanish
manera ms fiel posible o de la manera que ellos Spanish
desean mostrar se Y qu mejor manera que una web Spanish
que uno mismo administre y a la que uno mismo Spanish
suba la seleccin de informacin ms fiel a ese perfil Spanish
que se desea transmitir Y en algunos casos con resultados Spanish
fantsticos  A qu clases de riesgos nos exponen las Spanish
TIC ? Las nuevas maneras de participar de entornos de Spanish
dilogos abiertos a travs de las nuevas TIC ofrecen muchas Spanish
ventajas y amedrentar nos tenemos que conocer para saber prevenir Spanish
Con esto nos referimos a : Que cuando chateamos o Spanish
utilizamos el correo electrnico estamos dando en mayor o menor Spanish
medida datos personales y estos pueden ser utilizados por desconocidos Spanish
para averiguar detalles de nuestra intimidad que muchas veces no Spanish
estamos dispuestos a compartir con otros Que aunque alguien piense Spanish
que su imagen y las imgenes que portan las fotos Spanish
que se suben pueden ser utilizadas con fines muy determinados Spanish
a menudo en la prctica se terminan utilizando para cosas Spanish
que difieren en mucho de las intenciones de sus autores Spanish
Y es extremadamente difcil quitar de la web contenidos subidos Spanish
Los archivos que solemos recibir de personas desconocidas pueden contener Spanish
virus o datos no adecuados Que es relativamente fcil inventar Spanish
una identidad para establecer contactos a travs de internet Tan Spanish
fcil como crear una cuenta de correo o un usuario Spanish
de chat Como contrapartida es relativamente difcil saber quin es Spanish
el que nos ha escrito desde qu mquina y cundo Spanish
Que muchas veces donde se producen relaciones de poder y Spanish
abusos Esto nos lleva a estar alertas cuando personas que Spanish
desconocemos nos piden fotos personales o nos hacen preguntas de Spanish
nuestro entorno y nuestra vida familiar o nos envan fotos Spanish
personales aunque no se las hayamos solicitado y sobre todo Spanish
cuando insisten en encontrar se con nosotros en algn lugar Spanish
real Internet : un mundo peligroso con una riqueza enorme Spanish
La escuela es una de las pocas instituciones a las Spanish
que asisten  o deberan asistir  todos los nios Spanish
y adolescentes de nuestra sociedad Por eso es un lugar Spanish
privilegiado de encuentro entre adultos y jvenes donde el dilogo Spanish
puede dar se verdaderamente como proceso la cantidad de horas Spanish
compartidas la existencia de un lugar comn por la repeticin Spanish
de rituales cotidianos y la cantidad de docentes que trabajan Spanish
desempean en cada establecimiento La casa por su parte es Spanish
el lugar ms ntimo donde se trazan los vnculos primarios Spanish
y de socializacin inicial de las personas donde vivimos y Spanish
satisfacemos muchas necesidades bsicas Ambos espacios escuela y la relacin Spanish
entre los jvenes y las TIC Ese abordaje debera ser Spanish
desde nuestro punto de vista un acompaamiento Pero un camino Spanish
transitado en conjunto donde  sin borrar nuestro rol como Spanish
adultos responsables maestros padres etc  aprendamos a aprender de Spanish
los chicos aprendamos a compartir conversaciones y prcticas donde valoremos Spanish
sus propias maneras de usar las TIC Necesitamos construir una Spanish
relacin de confianza  ni intrusos ni indiferentes  con Spanish
nuestros estudiantes e hijos para que cuenten con nosotros cuando Spanish
tengan una duda cuando se sientan incmodos perciban algn riesgo Spanish
o estn siendo vctimas de algn tipo de acoso abuso Spanish
etc Comencemos por un principio bsico de la poca que Spanish
nos toca vivir Un principio que puede verse como debilidad Spanish
aunque en realidad se trata de una gran fortaleza Ni Spanish
el docente ni las profesoras ni los padres lo saben Spanish
todo y tampoco estn en condiciones de dar respuesta sobre Spanish
y cada uno de los problemas que presentan los nios Spanish
las nias y jvenes Ya nadie gran alivio comprender que Spanish
se puede ensear se puede transmitir valores y construir conceptos Spanish
con los jvenes sin que sea necesario ser el dueo Spanish
de los saberes legtimos Debemos ser capaces de establecer una Spanish
nueva relacin intergeneracional basada en la comunicacin la reflexin y Spanish
la voluntad de escuchar Si podemos partir de ese punto Spanish
ya estaremos dando un gran paso a la bsqueda de Spanish
soluciones compartidas  Qu podemos hacer los docentes ? Estar Spanish
alertas El rol de el docente es crucial a la Spanish
hora de detectar o reconocer cuando un nio o una Spanish
nia tiene un problema emocional o de comportamiento que puede Spanish
deber se a un posible abuso Generar las condiciones para Spanish
que los nios se animen a contar lo que viven Spanish
es un paso muy importante Para los nios y nias Spanish
se trata de una manera de comenzar a defender se Spanish
a crear redes de apoyo a encontrar a personas donde Spanish
depositar esperanzas de solucin Y tener en cuenta que cuando Spanish
los nios cuentan situaciones de abuso casi nunca mienten Es Spanish
preferible arriesgar se a considerar lo a priori falso porque Spanish
cuando un nio deja de confiar tambin deja de contar Spanish
Y recordar que el culpable es el agresor nunca el Spanish
propio nio Potenciar la autogestin y la autoproteccin El docente Spanish
tiene que trabajar para lograr que los nios y las Spanish
nias adquieran o refuercen su SEGURIDAD y AUTOESTIMA El nio Spanish
tiene que sentir se orgulloso de s mismo si quiere Spanish
superar el dao que le ha causado el abuso tiene Spanish
que volver a creer en su inteligencia en su astucia Spanish
y en su capacidad de encontrar salidas aunque se encuentre Spanish
frente a verdaderos callejones oscuros De la misma manera promover Spanish

de una minora numrica En el peor de los casos Spanish

visita de Kerry se podra haber interpretado con la gran Spanish
posibilidad de un verdadero paso adelante hacia un arreglo poltico Spanish
con los palestinos es de suponer que medio ejrcito israel Spanish
hubiese sido necesario movilizar para trasladar a el Canciller Norteamericano Spanish
los kilmetros que separan por tierra el aeropuerto Ben Gurion Spanish
de la capital de Israel El liderazgo de los colonos Spanish
judos de Cisjordania con sus colaboradores y representantes no se Spanish
ocupa de estupideces como las de un estado palestino [ Spanish

los rasgos de la prxima etapa : la institucionalizacin de Spanish
el poder israel permanente en Cisjordania Para Moshe Feiglin judo Spanish
religioso miembro de el parlamento por el Likud y serio Spanish
aspirante a su conduccin en el futuro la solucin mas Spanish
prctica es anexar toda Cisjordania a Israel en tanto que Spanish
a los palestinos residentes en la regin se les condicionar Spanish
sus derechos humanos sin recibir derechos como ciudadano Para los Spanish
rabes ciudadanos de Israel propone retirar les la ciudadana otorgndo Spanish

lo mnimo necesario para que esa poblacin pueda mantener se Spanish
que festejen sus fiestas [ ] La idea ms interesante Spanish
la plantea Moshe Arens el veterano idelogo de el Likud Spanish
Para este ex ministro de defensa de Israel no queda Spanish
otra alternativa ms que anexar los territorios de Cisjordania pero Spanish
a diferencia de las tpicas posiciones extremas de derecha en Spanish
este caso se propone otorgar plena ciudadana israel a la Spanish
poblacin palestina Para Arens en contraposicin a pronsticos pesimistas extender Spanish
la soberana israel a el territorio de Cisjordania incorporando milln Spanish

propuesto por Arens la aporta Uri Ariel Ministro de Vivienda Spanish
por el partido La Casa Juda Este importante funcionario estatal Spanish
tiene claro que no se puede anexar Cisjordania a Israel Spanish
dejando a sus habitantes sin ciudadana ni pertenencia Es de Spanish
suponer que rpidamente Israel seria declarada estado Apartheid con la Spanish
